<h2>HELD BACK.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="53" height="112" alt="S" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">SHE made a pretty picture standing there
on the veranda waiting for the carriage
to come around. It was the last time she
would ever stand there looking so fresh
and fair in the morning light. This is a
sad story, yet it has its bright side, so I hope
you will not turn away from it without gathering
up some of the sweetness that is shed as a
perfume from May Vinton's daily life.</div>

<p>May was an only, a much-petted, and some
people said, a spoiled child. However, this last
was a mistake. What might have been, had not
her Heavenly Father interfered, we cannot tell.
A friend of Mr. Vinton who was spending a few
days with the family was interested in the management
of a theatre, and this gentleman had
been studying this fair young daughter of his
host and had discovered what others among her
friends already knew, that she was a girl of unusual
talent, and he fancied that if she were educated
for the stage she would, as he expressed it,
"create a sensation." He had proposed to Mr.
Vinton to take May home with him and educate
her for his favorite profession. He had pictured
to the young girl the pleasures of such a
life, dwelling upon the sweetness of the world's
praises which she was sure to win. It would
have been no wonder if May's head had been
turned by all the flattery and promises of a brilliant
future. Mr. Vinton had given his consent
to the proposal of his friend, but May hesitated.</p>

<p>May Vinton was the only Christian in that
household; while at boarding-school she had
been led to give her heart to the Saviour, and
now that she was at home again she had found
it not quite easy to keep herself unspotted from
the world. Mr. Vinton had not openly opposed
her in what he termed her "fanaticism," but
now that her religion was in the way of what
was becoming his ambition for her, there was
likely to be trouble. And the perplexity into
which May was thrown showed itself in her face
that morning. There was just a slight shadow
in her brown eyes as she waited for her pony
phaeton to come around to the steps. She had
come from her room with this prayer on her
lips: "Dear Father, help me to decide rightly.
I am so ignorant and so foolish that I cannot tell
what is right. Canst thou not settle this question
for me? Shut up every path but the right
one, I pray thee."</p>

<p>How speedily God sometimes answers our
prayers!</p>

<p>It was the common story of a runaway horse,
a carriage thrown over a steep embankment.
And May Vinton, helpless and limp, was carried
home, not dead, but to hear the verdict of the
physicians who were hastily summoned, "She
may live for years, but she will never walk
again."</p>

<p>The father groaned when he heard it, but to
May even in that first hour of the terrible
knowledge there came a swift flashing thought
"The question is settled!"</p>

<p>This was twenty years ago. During those
first months of suffering, May Vinton's faith
sometimes grew faint and she prayed that she
might die; her life seemed useless; all its joy
and brightness gone out. Her faith looked forward
to the mansion prepared for her, but it did
not light up the present, at least not for a long
time. There came at length out of the suffering
a sweet peace that almost glorified the face,
which was a little thinner and paler than of old,
but now clothed with a new beauty. There
came too a tender patience that won and held
the hearts of all with a firmer grasp than ever
before.</p>

<p>Gradually the hearts of her father and mother
were won from the world and centred upon
Christ, and as one and another of those who came
in daily contact with the patient invalid were
led into a knowledge of the truth, May began
to realize that her life need not be a useless one,
and she began to interest herself in matters outside
her own home. I cannot tell you of all the
schemes for work which she has on foot. The
Mission Band meet in her room once a month.
I ought to tell you about that room. When it became
evident that she would spend the greater
part of her life in a reclining chair, only varying
the monotony by being lifted from chair to
couch or bed, Mr. Vinton fitted up what had
been the front parlor with a smaller room once
used as a library, for her use. "We can use a
back room for a parlor," he said, "but May must
have as good an outlook as we can give her."
Excepting the invalid herself in her chair there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is no sign of invalidism in that large room, but
as a young girl said the other day, "It is just as
pretty as it can be!" There are long mirrors
on every side, there is a piano, softest of carpets
and easiest of chairs&mdash;a few; in that little storeroom
at one side are dozens of folding chairs
which can be brought out when the visitors are
many, and this is very frequently. Once a month
the Mission Band, every week the Children's
meeting, every Sabbath afternoon a class of
young men. Then there is a young ladies' meeting&mdash;I
think I must take another time to tell
you of some of these gatherings. Sometimes
Miss Vinton is too ill to meet with the young
people, but the room is always ready for them
and a bright young girl who is her companion
takes the place of hostess.</p>

<p>"It must be very hard for you to be shut in
so much with an invalid," said an acquaintance
to this girl.</p>

<p>"O, I am not shut in! Miss Vinton has so
many errands to be attended to that I go out a
great deal."</p>

<p>"Yes; but after all, an invalid is poor company
for a young girl."</p>

<p>"Not such an invalid as ours! Why, Miss
Vinton is the cheeriest person in the house.
She keeps us all in good spirits and she has company
almost constantly. I assure you we are
not moping at our house."</p>

<p>Once when some one spoke of her wrecked
life May said, "O, no, my life is not wrecked!
I came near making a failure of it, but my Father
in heaven reached out and held me back."</p>

<h2>THE LAST OPPORTUNITY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-f.jpg" width="57" height="111" alt="F" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">FOR many years I have made it a rule
never to spend a half-hour with any
person without finding out if that person
was a Christian, and if not, trying
to preach Christ to him."</div>

<p>This in substance is what the minister said in
the little church at the quiet summer resort by
the river side, where Edith Manton was staying.
"For," continued the speaker, "it may be my
last opportunity to speak for Christ, or it may
be some one's last chance of hearing the truth."</p>

<p>Edith was thinking of these words that morning
when she went out in Jerry's boat after
lilies. Jerry knew where the flowers were
thickest and fairest, and too he was counted as
the best oarsman on the river. Edith often
went out with Jerry, and that morning she was
thinking, "I have had more than <i>one</i> opportunity
to present Christ to Jerry. But I do not even
know whether or not he belongs to Christ. If I
had only spoken to him before! I don't know
how to begin now." Presently she began singing,</p>

<div class='center'>
Pull for the shore, sailor, pull for the shore.<br />
</div>

<p>Jerry listened and when she ended he said:</p>

<p>"That's a good one, Miss."</p>

<p>"Yes; but, Jerry, are <i>you</i> pulling for the
other shore?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know much about them things,"
replied Jerry. "Reckon as how when one has
no oars to pull with he must just drift. And
maybe he will drift to the shore, and maybe he
won't."</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't you have the oars?"
asked Edith.</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose it's like this; sometimes a
boat gets loose and starts off without oars, and
then at other times the oars gets broken or lost
in the middle of the river. I never lost nor
broke an oar in my life, so I s'pose I must have
started without any."</p>

<p>"And so you mean to keep on drifting?"
asked Edith, growing interested.</p>

<p>"What can a fellow do? Out in the middle
of the river without any oars? He hasn't much
chance of getting back to the wharf after them."</p>

<p>"But if the oars have been lying in the bottom
of his boat all the time? Wouldn't a man
be foolish if he didn't pick them up and use
them when he found he was drifting down
stream and making no progress toward the
other shore?"</p>

<p>"Humph! it ain't much likely that a fellow
would let them oars lie right afore his eyes and
never touch them, is it, now?"</p>

<p>"That is what puzzles me," replied Edith.
"You have only just to put out the hand of
faith and take hold of the oars of prayer and the
word of God and pull for the shore."</p>

<p>"My! Miss, I never thought of that! I've
got a Bible that my old mother gave me when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I started out; and she taught me a prayer too.
And I've been letting them oars lie idle in the
bottom of the old boat all these years. D'ye
s'pose they are as good and stout as ever? And
would they pull an old fellow like me into port?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 457px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="457" height="322" alt="two people in boat on river" />
<div class="caption">OUT IN JERRY'S BOAT.</div>
</div>

<p>"I am sure they would. O, Jerry, I wish you
would take hold of them and pull!"</p>

<p>"I believe I will! I'll get out the old Bible
to-night and I'll say that little prayer; or if I
can't remember that I'll whittle out a new one.
I promise you, Miss, I'll do it!"</p>

<p>The next morning, Edith was just starting
out to walk down to the river when a messenger
came in haste: "O, Miss Manton! There's
been an accident, and Old Jerry is most killed!
He wants you. You'll have to come quickly,
for they say he can't last long. He is out of his
head and keeps saying something about pulling
for the shore. Folks say he thinks he is out in
a boat." This the boy said as they were hastening
to the wharf.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" asked Edith.</p>

<p>"I don't rightly know. They were unloading
a vessel at the wharf and some way Jerry
slipped and a heavy cask rolled over him. The
doctor says he can't live."</p>

<p>When they reached the place where Jerry
was slowly breathing his life away, some one
said&mdash;"Jerry, Jerry, here is Miss Manton!"</p>

<p>Jerry opened his eyes and said faintly, "Sing
that!"</p>

<p>And there, surrounded by a group of rough,
though kindly men, Edith sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Light in the darkness, sailor, day is at hand,<br />
See o'er the foaming billows, fair haven's land,<br />
Drear was the voyage, sailor, now almost o'er,<br />
Safe within the life-boat, sailor, <i>pull for the shore</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>As she paused
Jerry's lips moved,
and bending low
to hear, Edith
caught the whisper:</p>

<p>"I did it! I
took the oars; I
pulled for the
shore. I guess I'll
make the harbor!"</p>

<p>A few more labored
breaths and
Jerry had, as we
trust, "made the
harbor."</p>

<p>"What if I had
not used that last
opportunity?"
said Edith to herself
as she walked
back to her cottage.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>GRANDMA BURTON studied the verses

so the "little chick" had it, and the
first verse on the paper was taken.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandma, "I knew the boy very
well indeed who believed that, and lived by it;
and he got his help too in the way that he least
expected; just as help is apt to come. He was
a little fellow when I was quite a young woman.
We visited, my brother and I, at a house which
was only across the street from a famous boarding-school
for boys. There was one little fellow
in that school whom I used to watch, because
he looked like my little brother at home;
he seemed very small to be in boarding-school.
I wondered if he was homesick, and sometimes
cried himself to sleep as my brother did the first
time he went to uncle Daniel's alone on a visit.</p>

<img src="images/illus16.jpg" width="557" height="404" alt="Woman in long cloak holding an open parasol above her" />
<div class="caption">AUNT HARRIET PEABODY.</div>
</div>

<p>"Miss Harriet Peabody was the mistress of
this house where I visited; she was a maiden
lady, the aunt of the boy and girl who were our
friends; a good kind woman, but a little prim in
her ways. I remember she never dressed quite in
the fashion; her clothes were very nice, and
beautifully made, and cost a trifle more, if anything,
than those of her neighbors, but they were
always made a little behind the styles, as though
she thought things which were a little out of
fashion were less wicked, some way, than others.</p>

<p>"The young folks of the neighborhood, and
especially the boys of the boarding-school, were
inclined to make sport of her; this always made
me indignant, for I loved Miss Harriet. One
evening we were seated in the library, having
the cosiest time; the boys had popped some
corn, and cracked nuts, and we had apples and
cider; in those days an evening wasn't really
finished without a pitcher of cider; Miss Harriet
sat by the window, and said suddenly: 'Hark!
what is that? didn't you hear a child crying?'</p>

<p>"We listened, and said no, we heard nothing.
Her nephew suggested dogs, and doves, and owls,
but Miss Harriet insisted that she heard a child.</p>

<p>"We were soon in the very merriest of our
fun, and forgot all about the noise; but it seems
Miss Harriet didn't. I don't know just when
she slipped out, but just as Tom Peabody was
flinging an apple paring over his left shoulder,
to see if he couldn't make the first letter of my
name, in walked Miss Harriet, dripping with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
rain and holding by the hand a little frightened
boy; and he was the very boy I had watched
from the window so often! He was wet to the
skin, and shivering as though he had an ague fit.
We all jumped up, and gathered about asking
questions, but Miss Harriet waved us off. 'Not
yet,' she said. 'The poor fellow is wet and cold;
Tom, take him up to the bath-room, and get him
some of Robbie's clothes and help him dress;
then bring him down to get some nuts and apples.'</p>

<p>"Tom went off to do her bidding, and the rest
of us questioned her. 'I don't know much
about it, yet,' she said, 'but I mean to; there's
been some mean business going on, or I'm mistaken.
I <i>knew</i> I heard a child crying; when I
couldn't stand it any longer, I lighted the lantern
and went out to look around; I found the sobs
came from our old coal shed which hasn't been
used in six months. I listened at the end door,
and I heard the little fellow sob out: "I know
you are able to do it, O, Lord, and if you <i>only
would</i>!" Then I walked around to the other
door, and found it was fastened on the outside
by a good-sized rope slipped through the latch,
and wound around the big nail. Of course I
unfastened it and walked in; and here was this
little morsel crouched in a corner, dripping with
rain, as it pelted down on him from the roof.
He seemed dreadfully scared at seeing me, and
began to protest that he had done nothing wrong,
and did not want to be hiding there; but I told
him to come in and get warm, and then we
would talk about it.'</p>

<p>"When the boy came down with dry clothes
on, he looked less frightened than before; and
we established him in a big chair and gave him
plenty of nuts, and a glass of cider; I poured it
out with my own hands; you needn't look so
shocked at Grandmother, Harold, I didn't know
any better in those days. He had a real pleasant
evening, and Miss Harriet invited him to
stay all night, because it rained so hard, and sent
her black Toby over to the school to ask permission
for him, and told him she would make
it all right in the morning. He seemed to be so
glad to think he had not to go back to the
school, that we knew something must be wrong;
but it was not until he went up to bed with
Robbie, that Tom told us about it.</p>

<p>"'Those scamps over there,' said Tom, his
eyes flashing, 'they deserve a whipping, and I
will help get it for them. There are half a
dozen great boys always in mischief of one sort
or other. It seems they have made a kind of
slave of this little fellow; his mother is dead,
and he is the youngest boy in school; they have
made him run errands, and do all sorts of
things for them; to-night they planned that he
was to go down to Jordon's and get them some
nuts, and raisins, and cider, and cake, and smuggle
it into their rooms after hours, for them to
have what they call a 'spread.' And it seems the
little chap had the pluck to refuse to do it, because
it was against the rules. They had a
stormy time, and finally they threatened to lock
him up in a hole where he would have to spend
the night, and how much longer they could not
tell. It seems he is timid in the dark, and they
knew it. He was awfully afraid, he told me,
"but then I couldn't do wrong, you know," he
said, and his eyes were as blue as the sky, when
he looked up in my face. Well, the rascals
blindfolded him, and led him around and around
the grounds, I presume, for he thought he walked
a mile or more; then thrust him into a dark hole,
and fastened the door and left him. When he
pushed off the bandage from his eyes, no light
was to be seen; he had not the least idea where
he was, but thought it was somewhere in the
woods, and he was dreadfully afraid, and cried
aloud, he says, but he was sure no one could
hear him. Then he remembered about the fiery
furnace, and what the men said about God being
able to deliver, and he got down in the dark and
prayed for deliverance; but he says he didn't
feel <i>sure</i> it would come; he was only sure that
God was able to do it if he thought best. He
hadn't an idea, when he saw aunt Harriet, that
she had come to answer his prayer. He knew
her, and for some reason the little chap was
afraid of <i>her</i>. He thought that she had been
told that he had done something wrong.'</p>

<p>"'What horrid, awful boys!' I said. 'Do
you suppose they were going to leave him there
all night?'</p>

<p>"'No,' Tom said, he didn't suppose they were;
probably they were only going to leave him long
enough to get him thoroughly scared; but if he
was not much mistaken they were the scared
ones this time. Toby, when he went over to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
boarding-house, saw two or three fellows skulking
around the coal house, and he walked boldly
up to them and said: 'If you are looking for
Master Andrews, he is in Miss Peabody's library
eating nuts and apples;' Toby's a sharp fellow; he
said the way they scampered was worth a dollar.</p>

<p>"I suppose that evening's work was about the
best thing that ever happened to 'Master Andrews.'
Miss Harriet all but adopted him; she
had him with her on Sundays, and holidays, and
to spend the evening as often as she could get
up an excuse for his coming. He told me once,
with the great tears in his eyes, that she was
the best friend a fellow ever had in the world.
'And to think,' he said, 'that very morning of
the day she found me in her coal shed, I had
joined in the laugh the boys had over her because
she walked so straight and looked like a soldier!
I tell you I never laughed at her again.'"</p>

<p>"What became of the boys who treated him
so meanly? Were they expelled?"</p>

<p>"No; little Andrews plead for them, and got
them forgiven; he said they didn't mean to be
ugly, only darkness and rain were nothing but
fun to them and they could not understand his
dreadful fright. No, they really grew to be
better boys under his influence; and one Thanksgiving
Day Miss Harriet had them all to dinner,
to please Andrews. One of them, the
tallest and handsomest, actually cried when
he was telling me about how frightened little
Andrews was, and how sorry he felt for him
afterwards. He slipped out, unknown to the
others, to let him out of the coal shed; but
it was too late; fortunately, Miss Harriet had
found him. Oh! he wasn't a very bad boy, only
a thoughtless one; he grew to be a splendid
man; and young Andrews and he were friends
as long as he lived."</p>

<p>"Are they both dead?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; Andrews died when he was a young
man; he was a good noble man, and died bravely
because he wasn't afraid to run into danger to
help save a life; but the other one is down in
the library reading his paper, and I ought to go
this minute and read it for him." Grandma
fumbled for her spectacles, and went off smiling.</p>

<p>"There!" said Rollo, "I had a feeling it was
Grandpa, all the time. Just think of Grandma
calling him 'a horrid, awful boy!'"</p>

<h2>POEM FOR RECITATION.</h2>


<h3>THE TWO GREAT CITIES.</h3>

<div class='poem'><div class='drop-cap'>
SIDE by side the two great cities,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Afar on the traveller's sight.</span><br />
One, black with the dust of labor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One, solemnly still and white.</span><br />
Apart, and yet together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They are reached in a dying breath;</span><br />
But a river flows between them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the river's name is&mdash;Death.</span><br />
<br />
Apart, and yet together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Together, and yet apart,</span><br />
As the child may die at midnight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the mother's living heart.</span><br />
So close come the two great cities,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With only the river between;</span><br />
And the grass in the one is trampled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the grass in the other is green.</span><br />
<br />
The hills with uncovered foreheads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the disciples meet,</span><br />
While ever the flowing water<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is washing their hallowed feet.</span><br />
And out on the glassy ocean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sails in the golden gloom</span><br />
Seem to me but the moving shadows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the white enmarbled tomb.</span><br />
<br />
Anon from the hut and the palace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Anon, from early till late,</span><br />
They come, rich and poor, together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Asking alms at the beautiful gate.</span><br />
O silent city of refuge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the way to the city o'erhead!</span><br />
The gleam of thy marble milestones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tells the distance we are from the dead.</span><br />
<br />
Full of feet, but a city untrodden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full of hands, but a city unbuilt,</span><br />
Full of strangers who know not even<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That their life-cup lies there, spilt.</span><br />
They know not the tomb from the palace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They dream not they ever have died;</span><br />
God be thanked, they <i>never will</i> know it,<br />

<h2>THE ENGINE'S PUNISHMENT.</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='drop-cap'>
WE were driving along to town one day&mdash;<br />
Papa and I, behind "Old Gray,"<br />
And our little Fred was along beside,<br />
Looking out o'er the fields, enjoying the ride.<br />
<br />
I was sitting back reading, contented and calm,<br />
While Fred had the whip held tight in his palm,<br />
And was snapping it round at urchins and dogs,<br />
And sometimes at only some old rotten logs.<br />
<br />
We were crossing the track, when we heard such a shout<br />
That all of us jumped, and looked quickly about,<br />
When we saw the old flagman as frantic and wild<br />
As a pea on a shovel that's hot; and his child<br />
<br />
Screamed out "Stop, O, stop! here comes the train!"<br />
Papa looked quickly out, then drew in the rein.<br />
I shut my eyes tight, and held to the seat,<br />
And I knew I could hear my frightened heart beat!<br />
<br />
A rush and a roar, a sudden pull back,<br />
A "toot! toot! toot! toot!" and a terrible crack;<br />
And I heard papa say, "Cheer up, little maid,<br />
For here we are, safe, so don't be afraid!"<br />
<br />
"But what was that crack?" when I'd quite got my breath,<br />
And all things around us were silent as death<br />
(Except the low rumble of the distant train,<br />
Which, when we were safe, had steamed off again).<br />
<br />
"Why, Katy, 'twas me!" and Fred turned in his place,<br />
"I whipped the old engine right in the face!<br />
I guess he won't scare us again so, do you?<br />
For I gave him a cut that just made him boo, hoo!"<br />
<br />
Well, we laughed, and we laughed, till tears came in our eyes,<br />
At how little Fred did the engine chastise,<br />
Until over his face came a flush of bright red.<br />
"You are right; he won't scare us again," papa said.<br />

<h2>REACHING OUT.</h2>

<div class='center'>(<i>A further Account of Nettie Decker and her Friends.</i>)<br />

<span class="smcap">By Pansy.</span></div>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THAT was the way it came about that
little Sate not only, but Susie and Nettie,
went to the flower party.</div>

<p>They had not expected to do any
such thing. The little girls, who were
not used to going anywhere, had paid no attention
to the announcements on Sunday, and Nettie
had heard as one with whom such things had
nothing in common. Her treatment in the Sabbath-school
was not such as to make her long for
the companionship of the girls of her age,
and by this time she knew that her dress at the
flower party would be sure to command more
attention than was pleasant; so she had planned
as a matter of course to stay away.</p>

<p>But the little old ladies in their caps and spectacles
springing into active life, put a new face
on the matter. Certainly no more astonished
young person can be imagined than Nettie
Decker was, the morning Miss Sherrill called on
her, the one daisy she had begged still carefully
preserved, and proposed her plan of partnership
in the flower party.</p>

<p>"It will add ever so much to the fun," she
explained, "besides bringing you a nice little
sum for your spending money."</p>

<p>Did Miss Sherrill have any idea how far that
argument would reach just now, Nettie wondered.</p>

<p>"We can dress the little girls in daisies," continued
their teacher. "Little Sate will look like
a flower herself, with daisies wreathed about her
dress and hair."</p>

<p>"Little Sate will be afraid, I think," Nettie
objected. "She is very timid, and not used to
seeing many people."</p>

<p>"But with Susie she will not mind, will she?
Susie has assurance enough to take her through
anything. Oh, I wonder if little Sate would not
recite a verse about the daisy grandmothers?
I have such a cunning one for her. May I teach
her, Mrs. Decker, and see if I can get her to
learn it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Decker's consent was very easy to gain;
indeed it had been freely given in Mrs. Decker's
heart before it was asked. For Miss Sherrill had
not been in the room five minutes before she
had said: "Your son, Norman, I believe his
name is, has promised to help my brother with
the church flowers this evening. My brother
says he is an excellent helper; his eye is so true;
they had quite a laugh together, last week. It
seems one of the wreaths was not hung plumb;
your son and my brother had an argument about
it, and it was finally left as my brother had
placed it, but was out of line several inches. He
was obliged to admit that if he had followed
Norman's direction it would have looked much
better." After that, it would have been hard
for Miss Sherrill to have asked a favor which
Mrs. Decker would not grant if she could. <i>She</i>
saw through it all; these people were in league
with Nettie, to try to save her boy. What
wasn't she ready to do at their bidding!</p>

<p>There was but one thing about which she was
positive. The little girls could not go without
Nettie; they talked it over in the evening, after
Miss Sherrill was gone. Nettie looked distressed.
She liked to please Miss Sherrill; she
was willing to make many grandmothers; she
would help to put the little girls in as dainty
attire as possible, but she did <i>not</i> want to go to
the flower festival. She planned various ways;
Jerry would take them down, or Norm; perhaps
even <i>he</i> would go with them; surely
mother would be willing to have them go with
Norm. Miss Sherrill would look after them
carefully, and they would come home at eight
o'clock; before they began to grow very sleepy.</p>

<p>But no, Mrs. Decker was resolved; she could
not let them go unless Nettie would go with
them and bring them home. "I let one child
run the streets," she said with a heavy sigh,
"and I have lived to most wish he had died
when he was a baby, before I did it; and I said
then I would never let another one go out of my
sight as long as I had control; I can't go; but
I would just as soon they would be with you as
with me; and unless you go, they can't stir a
step, and that's the whole of it." Mrs. Decker
was a very determined woman when she set out
to be; and Nettie looked the picture of dismay.
It did not seem possible to her to go to a flower
party; and on the other hand it seemed really
dreadful to thwart Miss Sherrill. Jerry sat listening,
saying little, but the word he put in now
and then, was on Mrs. Decker's side; he owned
to himself that he never so entirely approved of
her as at that moment. He wanted Nettie to
go to the flower party.</p>

<p>"But I have nothing to wear?" said Nettie,
blushing, and almost weeping.</p>

<p>"Nothing to wear!" repeated Mrs. Decker in
honest astonishment. "Why, what do you
wear on Sundays, I should like to know? I'm
sure you look as neat and nice as any girl I ever
saw, in your gingham. I was watching you last
Sunday and thinking how pretty it was."</p>

<p>"Yes; but, mother, they all wear white at
such places; and I cut up my white dress, you
know, for the little girls; it was rather short for
me anyway; but I should feel queer in any other
color."</p>

<p>"O, well," said Mrs. Decker in some irritation,
"if they go to such places to show their
clothes, why, I suppose you must stay at home,
if you have none that you want to show. I
thought, being it was a church, it didn't matter,
so you were neat and clean; but churches are
like everything else, it seems, places for show."</p>

<p>Jerry looked grave disapproval at Nettie, but
she felt injured and could have cried. Was it
fair to accuse her of going to church to show her
clothes, or of being over-particular, when she
went every Sunday in a blue and white gingham
such as no other girl in her class would wear
even to school? This was not church, it was a
party. It was hard that she must be blamed
for pride, when she was only too glad to stay at
home from it.</p>

<p>"I can't go in my blue dress, and that is the
whole of it," she said at last, a good deal of
decision in her voice.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mrs Decker. "Then we'll
say no more about it; as for the little girls
going without you, they sha'n't do it. When I
set my foot down, it's <i>down</i>."</p>

<p>Jerry instinctively looked down at her foot
as she spoke. It was a good-sized one, and
looked as though it could set firmly on any question
on which it was put. His heart began to
fail him; the flower party and certain things
which he hoped to accomplish thereby, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
fading. He took refuge with Mrs. Smith to
hide his disappointment, and also to learn wisdom
about this matter of dress.</p>

<p>"Do clothes make such a very great difference
to girls?" was his first question.</p>

<p>"Difference?" said Mrs. Smith inquiringly,
rubbing a little more flour on her hands, and
plunging them again into the sticky mass she
was kneading.</p>

<div class="caption">THE TWO BEAUTIES THAT SATE SAW.</div>
</div>

<p>"Yes'm. They seem to think of clothes the
first thing, when there is any place to go to;
boys aren't that way. I don't believe a boy
knows whether his coat ought to be brown or
green. What makes the difference?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith laughed a little. "Well," she
said reflectively, "there is a difference, now
that's a fact. I noticed it time and again when
I was living with Mrs. Jennison. Dick would
go off with whatever he happened to have on;
and Florence was always in a flutter as to
whether she looked as well as the rest. I've
heard folks say that it is the fault of the
mothers, because they make such a fuss over the
girls' clothes, and keep rigging them up in something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bright, just to make 'em look pretty, till
they succeed in making them think there isn't
anything quite so important in life as what they
wear on their backs. It's all wrong, I believe.
But then, Nettie ain't one of that kind. She
hasn't had any mother to perk her up and make
her vain. I shouldn't think she would be one
to care about clothes much."</p>

<p>"She doesn't," said Jerry firmly. "I don't
think she would care
if other folks didn't.
The girls in her
class act hatefully
to her; they don't
speak, if they can
help it. I suppose
it's clothes; I don't
know what else;
they are always
rigged out like
hollyhocks or tulips;
they make fun
of her, I guess;
and that isn't very
pleasant."</p>

<p>"Is that the reason
she won't go to
the flower show
next week?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm, that's
the reason. All
the girls are going
to dress in white;
I suppose she
thinks she will look
queerly, and be
talked about. But
I don't understand
it. Seems to me if all
the boys were going
to wear blue coats,
and I knew it, I'd
just as soon wear
my gray one if gray
was respectable."</p>

</div>

<p>"She ought to have a white dress, now that's
a fact," said Mrs. Smith with energy, patting
her brown loaf, and tucking it down into the tin
in a skilful way. "It isn't much for a girl like
her to want; if her father was the kind of man
he ought to be, she might have a white dress for
best, as well as not; I've no patience with him."</p>

<p>"Her father hasn't drank a drop this week,"
said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Hasn't; well, I'm glad of it; but I'm thinking
of what he has done, and what he will go
and do, as likely as not, next week; they might
be as forehanded as any folks I know of, if he
was what he ought to be; there isn't a better
workman in the town. Well, you don't care
much about the flower party, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I don't now," said Jerry, wearily. "When
I thought the little girls were going, I had a plan.
Sate is such a little thing, she would be sure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
be half-asleep by eight o'clock; and I was going
to coax Norm to come for her, and we carry her
home between us. Norm won't go to a flower
party, out and out; but he is good-natured, and
was beginning to think a great deal of Sate;
then I thought Mr. Sherrill would speak to him.
The more we can get Norm to feeling he belongs
in such places, the less he will feel like belonging
to the corner groceries, and the streets."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mrs. Smith admiringly. "Well,
I do say I didn't think Nettie was the kind of
girl to put a white dress between her chances
of helping folks. Sarah Ann thinks she's a real
true Christian; but Satan does seem to be into
the clothes business from beginning to end."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it is any easier for a Christian
to be laughed at and slighted, than it is for
other people," said Jerry, inclined to resent the
idea that Nettie was not showing the right spirit;
although in his heart he was disappointed in her
for caring so much about the color of her dress.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about that," said Mrs.
Smith, stopping in the act of tucking her bread
under the blankets, to look full at Jerry, "why,
they even made fun of the Lord Jesus Christ;
dressed him up in purple, like a king, and
mocked at him! When it comes to remembering
that, it would seem as if any common Christian
might be almost glad of a chance to be made
fun of, just to stand in the same lot with him."</p>

<p>This was a new thought to Jerry. He studied
it for awhile in silence. Now it so happened
that neither Mrs. Smith nor Jerry remembered
certain facts; one was that Mrs. Smith's kitchen
window was in a line with Mrs. Decker's bedroom
window, where Nettie had gone to sit
while she mended Norm's shirt; the other was
that a gentle breeze was blowing, which brought
their words distinctly to Nettie's ears. At first
she had not noticed the talk, busy with her own
thoughts; then she heard her name, and paused
needle in hand, to wonder what was being said
about her. Then, coming to her senses, she determined
to leave the room; but her mother,
for convenience, had pushed her ironing table
against the bedroom door, and then had gone to
the yard in search of chips; Nettie was a prisoner;
she tried to push the table by pushing
against the door, but the floor was uneven, and
the table would not move; meantime the conversation
going on across the alleyway, came
distinctly to her. No use to cough, they were
too much interested to hear her. By and by she
grew so interested as to forget that the words
were not intended for her to hear. There were
more questions involved in this matter of dress
than she had thought about. Her cheeks began to
burn a little with the thought that her neighbor
had been planning help for Norm, which she
was blocking because she had no white dress!
This was an astonishment! She had not known
she was proud. In fact, she had thought herself
very humble, and worthy of commendation because
she went Sabbath after Sabbath to the
school in the same blue and white dress, not so
fresh now by a great deal as when she first
came home. When Mrs. Smith reached the sentence
which told of the Lord Jesus being robed
in purple, and crowned with thorns, and mocked,
two great tears fell on Norm's shirt sleeve.</p>

<p>It was a very gentle little girl who moved
about the kitchen getting early tea; Mrs. Decker
glanced at her from time to time in a bewildered
way. The sort of girl with whom she was best
acquainted would have slammed things about a
little; both because she had not clothes to wear
like other children, and because she had been
blamed for not wanting to do what was expected
of her. But Nettie's face had no trace of anger,
her movements were gentleness itself; her voice
when she spoke was low and sweet: "Mother, I
will take the little girls, if you will let them go."</p>

<p>Mrs. Decker drew a relieved sigh. "I'd like
them to go because <i>she</i> asked to have them; and
I can see plain enough she is trying to get hold
of Norm; so is <i>he</i>; that's what helping with the
flowers means; and there ain't anything I ain't
willing to do to help, only I couldn't let the little
girls go without you; they'd be scared to death,
and it wouldn't look right. I'm sorry enough
you ain't got suitable clothes; if I could help it,
you should have as good as the best of them."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Nettie, "I don't think I
care anything about the dress now." She was
thinking of that crown of thorns. So when Miss
Sherrill called the way was plain and little Sate
ready to be taught anything she would teach her.</p>

<p>They went away down to the pond under the
clump of trees which formed such a pretty shade;
and there Sate's slow sweet voice said over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
lines as they were told to her, putting in many
questions which the words suggested. "He makes
the flowers blow," she repeated with thoughtful
face, then: "What did He make them for?"</p>

<p>"I think it was because He loved them; and
He likes to give you and me sweet and pleasant
things to look at."</p>

<p>"Does He love flowers?"</p>

<p>"I think so, darling."</p>

<p>"And birds? See the birds!" For at that
moment two beauties standing on the edge of
their nest, looked down into the clear water, and
seeing themselves reflected in its smoothness began
to talk in low sweet chirps to their shadows.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, He loves the birds, I am sure; think
how many different kinds He has made, and how
beautiful they are. Then He has given them
sweet voices, and they are thanking Him as well
as they know how, for all his goodness. Listen."</p>

<p>Sure enough, one of the birds hopped back a
trifle, balanced himself well on the nest, and
putting up his little throat trilled a lovely song.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" asked Sate.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Miss Sherrill, with
a little laugh. Sate was taxing her powers
rather too much. "But God understands, you
know; and I'm sure the words are sweet to him."</p>

<p>Sate reflected over this for a minute, then
went back to the flowers: "What made Him
put the colors on them? Does He like to see
pretty colors, do you sink? Which color does
He like just the very bestest of all?"</p>

<p>"O you darling! I don't know that, either.
Perhaps, crimson; or, no, I think He must like
pure white ones a little the best. But He likes
little human flowers the best of all. Little
white flowers with souls. Do you know what
I mean, darling? White hearts are given to the
little children who try all the time to do right, because
they love Jesus, and want to please him."</p>

<p>"Sate wants to," said the little girl. "Sate
loves Jesus; she would like to kiss him."</p>

<p>"I do not know but you shall, some day.
Now shall we take another line of the hymn?"</p>

<p>"I tried to teach her," explained Miss Sherrill
to her brother. "But I think, after all, she
taught me the most. She is the dearest little
thing, and asks the strangest questions! When
I look at her grave sweet face, and hear her
slow, sweet voice making wise answers, and asking
wise questions, a sort of baby wisdom, you
know, I can only repeat over and over the
words: 'Of such is the kingdom of heaven.'
To-day I told her the story of Jesus taking the
little children up in his arms and blessing them.
She listened with that thoughtful look in her
eyes which is so wonderful, then suddenly she
held up her pretty arms and said in the most
coaxing tones: 'Take little Sate to Him, and let
Him bless her, yight away.' Tremaine, I could
hardly keep back the tears. Do you think He
can be going to call her soon?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily at all. There is no reason
why a little child should not live very close to
Him on earth. I hope that little girl has a great
work to do for Christ in this world. She has a
very sweet face."</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IT was Kitty's moving day. This is how
it happened: One Saturday morning
Mr. Blake came into the barn and said:
"John, we will be ready to draw in
that hay by ten o'clock. We will fill up the bay
first. As soon as you feed the horses you may as
well take a look for hens' nests. We do not want
to cover up any hens this year!"</div>

<p>Now I do not suppose that Kitty really understood
what they were saying; probably the
sound of their voices alarmed her and she concluded
to move. First she set out to hunt up a
home. There was the empty clothes basket;
Bridget had been late with her ironing and had
set the basket emptied of the clean clothes down
in a hurry, and a blanket had been thrown into
it. Walking into the deserted laundry on her
round of house hunting Kitty spied this and decided
that it was just the place. And so she
set about moving her family. By ten o'clock it
was accomplished and a happier group it would
be hard to find than Kitty and her little kitties
were when Bridget going after the basket found
them having a grand frolic. It seemed such a
pity to disturb them! But kind-hearted Bridget
brought an unused basket and very tenderly
moved the family once more. Mother Kitty
seemed quite satisfied, though rather shy of visitors
aside from Bridget, whom she seems to
look upon as a friend.</p>

<h2>WHERE I WENT, AND WHAT I SAW.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">I STARTED from Cincinnati. Only a
short ride on the "Bee Line" and I
reached Dayton. A beautiful little city;
looking, after the greatness and the noise,
and the smoke of Cincinnati, like a pretty little
village nestling in among trees. Yet when one
forgets the large places, Dayton is quite a city.
However, it is not about the <i>city</i> that I want to
tell you, but rather about a home there.</div>

<p>A lovely home. In the rooms are gathered
all the beautiful things which go to make up a
pretty house; carpets and curtains, and easy
chairs and lovely plush-covered sofas, and pictures,
and books, and flowers, and birds. I cannot
think of anything that they lacked. Yet all
these do not make lovely <i>homes</i>. I have been
in places filled with all the beauties which
money could buy, and arranged with all the
care which refined taste could give, yet which
were not homes at all, but great beautiful cold
<i>rooms</i>! Haven't you been in places where the
carpets were only ingrain, or perhaps rag, or
where there was even no carpet at all, and
the chairs were plain wooden ones, and the
pictures on the walls were only a few cheap
mottoes, yet which was all full of gentle words,
and cheery smiles, and unselfishness in little
things? Such places are sure to be homes. I
have discovered that the furniture makes very
little difference, after all. Well, the house at
which I stopped was a <i>home</i> in the truest sense
of the word. I shall never think of the sweet
Christian lady who is at its head, without feeling
thankful to God for having made so good and
true a woman, and given her so many beautiful
things to use in making others happy.</p>

<p>After all that, I am afraid you will be astonished
that I should only tell you the story of one
member of the family. But you can't think how
much she interested me. I reached the home late
at night and went at once to my room. In the
early morning I was awakened by a loud call from
a voice downstairs. "Clara!" shouted the shrill
voice, then waited, and seeming to get no reply,
screamed again, "Clara!" with no better success
than before. This was repeated I should
think a dozen times; until from being only
amused I became half-vexed. I thought it very
strange that in so fine a house and with so many
evidences of culture, the mistress should allow
a servant to stand in the hall below and scream
after any one in that way. Then I wondered
who "Clara" was, and why in the world she did
not answer the call; it did not seem possible that
she could be asleep, after her name had been
rung out so often. I buried my head in the pillows
and tried to take another nap; but that
was impossible; there that persistent servant
stood, and shouted out at intervals that one
name, dwelling on each letter until it seemed to
me that the name was a half-hour long! At
last I arose in despair, and began to make my
toilet; only hoping that "Clara's" slumbers had
been disturbed as well as my own.</p>

<p>When I made my way to the back parlor,
none of the family was in sight, but in the middle
of the floor looking at me with doubtful eyes,
as though she would like to know where I came
from, and what right I had there, was a great
green parrot! I was not very well acquainted
with parrots, so I stood at a respectful distance,
but I thought it was proper to be courteous,
and I said "Good-morning!"</p>

<p>To this I received no sort of reply; the creature
put her head on one side and looked somewhat
disdainful; then raising her voice to a loud
shrill note, she called "C-l-a-r-a!" The mystery
was explained! Here was the "servant" who
had shown such ill breeding in the beautiful
home.</p>

<p>Presently we went in to breakfast, and Polly
parrot went along. She moved about the dining-room,
wherever she chose, and was very
quiet, until one of the young ladies whose name
I discovered was "Clara," went away to attend
to some household duty; then Miss Polly began
her cry for "C-l-a-r-a" so loud we could
hardly converse. "Polly," said her mistress,
"you must be quiet; you disturb us; you cannot
go to Clara, she is busy."</p>

<p>What did that parrot do but throw herself
on her back, kick her clumsy feet into the air,
and cry with all her might! I saw no tears, it
is true; but if I had not been looking on, I would
have been sure that a very spunky child was
having a fit of crying. Imagine my astonishment!
I had never heard a parrot cry; did not
know that it was ever one of their accomplishments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Being a parrot, what would have been
extremely disagreeable in a child, was really
as funny as possible, and I laughed until I was
in danger of shedding tears myself. Still the
passionate whine went on. Suddenly the back
parlor door was opened slightly, and a sweet
voice said: "Mamma, you may let Polly come
to me; I am not doing anything which she will
disturb."</p>

<p>"Polly," said her mistress, "do you hear
that? Get up. Clara says you may go where
she is."</p>

<p>Instantly the parrot rolled over on her side,
and burst into the most jubilant peal of laughter
I ever heard&mdash;"Ha, ha, ha! ho, ho!" triumph
in every note.</p>

<p>Then she straightened herself up, shook out
her feathers, and waddled triumphantly out of
the room.</p>

<p>"She is a curious creature," said the lady;
"quite a study. We have not had her long, and
it is very amusing to us; we know the habits
and customs of the family from whom she came
almost as well as though we had lived with
them. You know parrots get all their knowledge
by imitation. Isn't it remarkable, and rather
startling when one stops to think of it, that even
a parrot can produce your faults and foibles for
others to laugh at? I often wonder what I am
teaching her, unintentionally, which will astonish
some one else."</p>

<p>"It is wonderful!" I said. And then I fell
to wondering whether it was a girl or boy who
had taught that parrot to lie on its back and cry
because it couldn't have its own way. And
what sort of a man or woman such a child would
be likely to make.</p>

<p>I doubt whether the child, whoever he
was, would have done it before me&mdash;a stranger&mdash;and
here the parrot had told me all
about it!</p>

</div>
<div class="drop-capi">"WHEN the box was opened," the
pin continued, "all the papers
were taken out, and carried to
a large dry goods store in what
seemed to me a very large city.
We were put just behind one of the
large glass windows, where everybody could see
us, and we felt quite proud, and much enjoyed
looking at all the strange things, and at people
who passed.</div>

<p>"One by one the papers were sold, until
finally ours was the only one left, and we remained
so long in the window that we began to
think we should never get out. By that time we
were tired of staring out at the street all the
time, and wanted a change. One day a lady
came into the store and asked the clerk for some
pins.</p>

<p>"So he came over to the window and took us
out. How delighted we were! The lady put
us in her little satchel, and soon we felt ourselves
rolling along the street in a carriage.
Pretty soon we were taken out and laid in the
bureau drawer of the lady's room, where we remained
a long while. Then she laid us on the
little shelf belonging to the bureau, where we
could see everything that went on in the room.</p>

</div>

<p>"One evening I was put in the lady's collar,
and went to a great room, brightly lighted,
where my mistress danced with gentlemen all
the evening. I enjoyed it very much, because
it was so strange, and because I have no feelings;
but my mistress grew very tired and sleepy as
soon as the ball, for that is what she called it,
was over.</p>

<p>"At night, or rather early in the morning,
when we reached home, she put me on the pin-cushion,
where I found many of my former
acquaintances.</p>

<p>"Now our life grew rather dull. I think
winter-time came, and my mistress removed to
a warmer room. After a long, long while, during
which we saw no one, when the birds returned,
and the buds came on the trees, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
moved back again, but now there was somebody
with her&mdash;a little bit of a baby! How cute it
was! We pins discussed it a great deal, and
grew to loving it very much.</p>

<p>"One day its nurse took it out to ride in its
little carriage, and took me (how delighted I
was!) to pin its dress. We went a long way
off, to a part of the city where the houses were
smaller, and the yards larger, and there were
more flowers and trees. The nurse stopped in
front of one of the little white houses, and walked
in, rolling the baby-carriage before her. She
called the woman who came to the door
'mother,' so I supposed that this was her former
home. Her mother took her to another room,
and they were gone quite awhile. So the baby
for something to do, and putting up its fat little
hand, took hold of me, and tried to pull me out
of its dress.</p>

<p>"Now I knew that the baby put everything
in its mouth that it could, so I stuck on just as
hard as I could; but it tugged away at me,
finally got me out, and put me in its mouth,
much to my dismay. Not only was it very disagreeable
for me to be there, but I knew there
was danger of the baby's swallowing me. Still,
I could do nothing. The little one chewed me
and poked me around with its tongue, until
finally, by a mis-poke&mdash;as you might say&mdash;it
sent me down its throat, and there I stuck.
Then, O, what a commotion there was! The
child screamed slightly, swallowed, and gurgled,
and choked, and I&mdash;O, my dear friend, you cannot
imagine my state of mind! To think I should
be the cause of such suffering, and possibly the
death of one I loved so much!</p>

<p>"Finally the noise that the child made
brought the nurse and her mother to the room.
'Mercy on us!' exclaimed the former, 'the child
is choking to death!'</p>

<p>"The mother took the baby on her lap, and
pounded, actually pounded, on its back! But
this treatment was effectual, though apparently
cruel, for the pounding sent me on the floor, out
of the baby's mouth! I cannot express my delight
in the feeble words that our language
possesses. I was in ecstasies. The nurse's
mother picked me up, and seeing where I had
come from, replaced me in the child's dress,
cautioning her daughter to keep watch of me.</p>

<p>"Then we speedily returned home. The story
was recounted with many apologies on the part
of the nurse. I think the baby's mother would
have discharged the poor girl, only, as she afterwards
remarked to her husband, 'that was a
very difficult season to get good nurses.'</p>

<p>"That night I was replaced on the cushion,
and was not taken off for what seemed to me
ages. I was in a part of the cushion where
beads where, and I suppose my head looked so
much like them, that I was not noticed. The
other pins were gradually taken out of the paper,
used, and either lost or replaced on the
cushion, till finally they were all gone, and a
new paper was bought. These, of course, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
strangers to me, but I soon became acquainted
with those on the cushion, and they were very
pleasant. On the whole, I did not so much dislike
my life then, though naturally enough, I
wanted a change.</p>

<p>"The family was quite a large one; beside
my mistress and her husband, there was the
baby, the nurse, a dear old lady whom I loved
very much, a little girl about twelve years old,
and a middle-aged lady whom the children called
auntie. Before I had been swallowed, I had had
occasion to be
used by all these
people, and so
felt acquainted
with them.</p>

<p>"Well, one
week there was a
great commotion
in the house.
Trunks were being
packed, things
being folded up
and put in packages,
and from
divers remarks
that different
members of the
household made,
I learned that
they were all going
to Europe,
excepting the old
lady, because,
they said, her
health was not
good enough to
go. This seemed rather strange, for they said
they <i>were</i> going for the health of the baby and
its mother. I did not know whether I was to
go with them or with the old lady, who was to
remain with a friend of hers at a town not far
distant. (All this I learned by using&mdash;not my
ears, for I have none, but my sense of hearing.)
I rather hoped my fate would be the latter, for
although I was anxious to travel, I thought I
would be lonely without the old lady, who,
though I could neither talk to her, nor understand
all of her talk, had become very dear to me.</p>

<div class="caption">"THE BOUNDLESS OCEAN ALL AROUND US."</div>
</div>

<p>"Well, my pin-cushion was put in a satchel,
and I felt myself rolling along in a carriage.
Then I knew no more of where I was going, or
what was happening around me, until one morning
the satchel was opened, the cushion taken
out, I was discovered, and put in the cuff of my
mistress. She was in a queer little closet, with
two shelves with bedclothes on them against the
wall, and a little bit of a window high up.</p>

<p>"Then she went out, and soon I found that
we were on the deck of a great steamship, with
the boundless ocean all around us."</p>

<h2>OUR ALPHABET OF GREAT MEN.</h2>

<h3>M.&mdash;MORSE, SAMUEL FINLEY BREESE.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-l.jpg" width="71" height="116" alt="L" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">LONG before he reached the pinnacle of
his fame, Samuel Finley Breese Morse
passed many quiet summer hours on
the pleasant wooded borders of the
ravine overlooking the peaceful Sconondoah;
and even to this day if you wander
through the beautiful Sconondoah wood and
hunt out its sequestered nooks, you will find
here and there, cut deep in the rugged bark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
old forest trees, the initials S. F. B. M., carved
by his hand more than half a century ago.</div>

<p>Professor Morse was born at Charlestown,
Mass., in 1791. He was the son of a Congregational
clergyman, who was the author of a series
of school geographies familiar to our fathers and
mothers in their schooldays. He was educated
at Yale College, and, intending to become a
painter, went to London to study art under Benjamin
West; but becoming interested in scientific
studies he was for many years president of
the National Academy of Design in New York.
He resided abroad three or four years. On returning
home in 1832 the conversation of some
gentlemen on shipboard in regard to an experiment
which had recently been tried in Paris
with the electro-magnet, interested him and
started a train of thought which gave him the
conception of the idea of the telegraph. The
question arose as to the length of time required
for the fluid to pass through a wire one hundred
feet long. Upon hearing the answer, that
it was instantaneous, the thought suggested itself
to Prof. Morse that it might be carried to any
distance and be the means of transmitting intelligence.
Acting upon the thought, he set to work,
and before the ship entered New York harbor
had conceived and made drawings of the telegraph.
He plodded on through weary years
endeavoring to bring his invention to perfection,
meeting on every hand jeers and ridicule and
undergoing many painful reverses in fortune;
but for his indomitable will, he would have
given up his project long before he succeeded in
bringing it before the public, for all thought it
a wild scheme which would amount to nothing.</p>

<p>In 1838 he applied to Congress for aid that
he might form a line of communication between
Washington and Baltimore. Congress was quite
disposed to regard the scheme a humbug. But
there was a wire stretched from the basement of
the Capitol to the ante-room of the Senate
Chamber, and after watching "the madman," as
Prof. Morse was called, experiment, the committee
to whom the matter was referred decided
that it was not a humbug, and thirty thousand
dollars was appropriated, enabling him to carry
out his scheme. Over these wires on the 24th of
May, 1844, he sent this message from the rooms
of the U. S. Supreme Court to Baltimore:
"What hath God wrought!" and connected with
this message is quite a pretty little story. Having
waited in the gallery of the Senate Chamber till
late on the last night of the session to learn the fate
of his bill, while a Senator talked against time, he
at length became discouraged, and confident that
the measure would not be reached that night
went to his lodgings and made preparations to
return to New York on the morrow. The next
morning, at breakfast, a card was brought to him,
and upon going to the parlor he found Miss
Annie Ellsworth, the daughter of the Commissioner
of Patents, who said she had come to
congratulate him upon the passage of his bill.
In his gladness he promised Miss Ellsworth that
as she had been the one to bring him the tidings,
she should be the first to send a message over
the wires. And it was at her dictation that the
words, "What hath God wrought?" were sent.</p>

<p>Success was now assured; honors and riches
were his, and those who had been slow to believe
in the utility of his invention were now
proud of their countryman and delighted to do
him homage. Upon going abroad again he was
received more as a prince than as a plain American
citizen, kings and their subjects giving him
honor. It may be believed that even in his
wildest flights of fancy Professor Morse did not
dream of the rapid spread of the use of his invention,
or look forward to the time within a
few years, when the telegraph wires would
weave together the ends of the world and form
a network over the entire Continent.</p>

<p>Five years ago, the only telegraph wire in
China was one about six miles in length, stretching
from Shanghai to the sea, and used to inform
the merchants of the arrival of vessels at
the mouth of the river. A line from Pekin to
Tientsin was opened a few months ago. The
capital of Southern China is in communication
with the metropolis of the North, and as Canton
was connected by telegraph with the frontier of
Tonquin at the outbreak of the late political
troubles, the telegraph wires now stretch from
Pekin to the most southern boundary of the Chinese
Empire, and China, ever slow to adopt foreign
ideas, is crossed and re-crossed by wires; we
may say the thought which came to Prof. Morse
upon that memorable voyage has reached out and
taken in the whole world.</p>

<h2>HOW FATHER CURED HIS HORSE.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>"WELL," exclaimed Reuben the story-teller,
"father always wanted a horse, because
the folks in Greene lived scattered, and he had so
far to go to attend funerals, weddings and visit
schools; but he never felt as if he could afford
to buy one. But one day he was coming afoot
from Hildreth, and a stranger asked him to ride.</div>

<p>"Father said: 'That's a handsome horse you're
driving. I should like to own him myself.'</p>

<p>"'What will you give for him?' said the man.</p>

<p>"'Do you want to sell?' says father.</p>

<p>"'Yes, I do; and I'll sell cheap, too,' says he.</p>

<p>"'Oh, well,' says father, 'it's no use talking;
for I haven't the money to buy with.'</p>

<p>"'Make an offer,' said he.</p>

<p>"'Well, just to put an end to the talk,' father
says, 'I'll give you seventy-five dollars.'</p>

<p>"'You may have him,' says the man; 'but
you'll repent of your bargain in a week.'</p>

<p>"'Why, what ails the horse?' says father.</p>

<p>"'Ails him? If he has a will to go, he'll go;
but, if he takes a notion to stop, you can't start
him. I've stood and beat that horse till the
sweat ran off of me in streams; I've fired a gun
close to his ears; I've burned shavings under
him. But he wouldn't budge an inch.'</p>

<p>"'I'll take him,' says father; 'what's his name?'</p>

<p>"'George,' said the man.</p>

<p>"'I shall call him Georgie,' said father.</p>

<p>"Well, father brought him home, and we
boys fixed a place for him in the barn, and curried
him down and fed him well, and father said, 'Talk
to him, boys, and let him know you feel friendly.'</p>

<p>"So we coaxed and petted him, and the next
morning father harnessed him and got into the
wagon to go. But Georgie wouldn't stir a step.
Father got out and patted him, and we brought
him apples and clover-tops; and once in a while
father would say, 'Get up, Georgie,' but he
didn't strike the horse a blow. By and by he
says: 'This is going to take time. We'll see
which has the most patience, you or I.' So he
sat in the wagon and took out his skeletons"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Skeletons?" said Poppet, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Of sermons, you know. Ministers always
carry around a little book to put things into
they think of when they are out walking or riding
or hoeing in the garden.</p>

<p>"Well, father sat two full hours before the
horse was ready to start; but, when he did,
there was no more trouble for that day. The
next morning 'twas the same thing over again,
only Georgie give in a little sooner. All the
while it seemed as if father couldn't do enough
for the horse. He was round the stable, feeding
him and fussing over him, and talking to him in
his pleasant, gentle way; and the third morning,
when he had fed and curried him and harnessed
him with his own hands, somehow there was a
different look in the horse's eyes. But when
father was ready to go, Georgie put his feet together
and laid his ears back, and wouldn't stir.
Well, Dove was playing about the yard; and she
brought her stool and climbed up by the horse's
head. Dove, tell what you said to Georgie?"</p>

<p>"I gave him a talking to," said the little girl.
"I told him it was perfectly 'diculous for him to
act so; that he'd come to a real good place to
live, where everybody helped everybody; that
he was a minister's horse, and God would not
love him if he was not a good horse. That's
what I told him; then I kissed him on the nose."</p>

<p>"And what did Georgie do?"</p>

<p>"Why, he heard every word I said; and when
I got through, he felt so 'shamed of himself he
couldn't hold up his head; so he just dropped
it till it almost touched the ground, and he
looked as sheepish as if he had been stealing a
hundred sheeps."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Reuben; "and when father told
him to go, he walked off like a shot. He has
never made any trouble since. That's the way
father cured a balky horse. And that night
when he was unharnessing, he rubbed his head
against his shoulder, and told him, as plain as a
horse could speak, that he was sorry. He's
tried to make it up with father ever since, for
the trouble he made him. When he's loose in
the pasture, father has only to stand at the bars
and call his name, and he walks up as quiet as
an old sheep. Why, I've seen him back himself
between the shafts of the old wagon many a
time to save father trouble. Father wouldn't
take two hundred dollars for the horse to-day.
He eats anything you give him. Sis very often
brings out some of her dinner to him."</p>

<p>"He likes to eat out of a plate," said Dove;
"it makes him think he's folks."&mdash;<i>Golden Censer.</i></p>

<h2>ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON.</h2>



<div class='center'><span class="smcap">By Margaret Sidney.</span></div>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a2.jpg" width="72" height="114" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">AND "St. George" he was from that day.
George Edward was powerless to stop
it, though he flew into innumerable
small rages and offered to whip any
boy who uttered the obnoxious name.
They became silent, for he was good for his
promises, they knew, but the girls took it up,
and as he could not very well whip them, his
sainthood grew speedily and beyond his control.</div>

<p>It was the day before Washington's Birthday.
The snow was deep on the ground, piled high
in drifts here and there, the air was clear, and
the sun bright. Everything promised beautifully
for the holiday to which the school looked
forward on the morrow.</p>

<p>"St. George" ran home early from school, and
flung down his bag of books on the sitting-room
table.</p>

<p>"I'm to be off early in the morning, mother,"
he said. "Put me up a rousing good lunch,
do."</p>

<p>"You are sure you can have steady fires in
the house? Mr. Bangs' man can be relied on?"
Mrs. Allen's voice was a bit anxious.</p>

<p>"Tiptop." "St. George" was busy extricating
his foot from its protecting boot. "Now then,
for my 'slips' and then the old books. I'll get
these lessons inside my head and out of the way
before night."</p>

<p>"Because if there is a little carelessness in
this respect," continued his mother, "you might
take a cold that would last you all winter. The
only reason your father consented to your going,
George, you know very well, was because the
house is so near your playground that you could
run in and get warmed whenever you felt
chilly."</p>

<p>"Right on the playground, mother, you
mean," corrected "St. George" with a laugh;
"it's set on Sachem Hill itself&mdash;up in the clouds
in a jolly fashion."</p>

<p>"There was one other reason," added Mrs.
Allen after a pause, "and that was, he said 'I
can trust George Edward.'"</p>

<p>The boy occupied with his other boot looked
up quickly, said nothing, but a bright smile
flashed over his face; and he jumped up, ran for
his slippers, and settled down to work with a
will.</p>

<p>The next morning was a fine one, and the nine
o'clock train saw a gay party of twenty-five boys
with knapsacks or bags containing lunch and
skates assembled at the B. and A. Depot ready
to board the train for Sachem Hill. Thomas,
Mr. Bangs' man, had gone up the day before to
open the country house left unoccupied since
the family's return to town in the autumn. And
he was already making fires, and getting things
into comfortable shape for the boys' arrival for
the grand frolic to which Wilfred Bangs had invited
his very especial friends; the parents of
the twenty-four boys only insisting that their
sons should each carry his own lunch, to add to
the hot coffee for which Thomas was famous.</p>

<p>So here they were. And a long grand day
before them!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Now see here, Old Saint"&mdash;one of the boys
was thoroughly provoked and he meant to show
it&mdash;"if you want to go around the world making
yourself disagreeable, just keep on with that
talk, 'we ought to stop' and so forth. Don't
you suppose we know what we're about. There's
plenty of time to catch that train. I for one
shall have one more skate up the pond and back,
and I'll bet you a new knife I'm at the depot as
soon as you are."</p>

<p>"St. George doesn't preach," cried an impulsive
champion. "And besides, he always <i>does</i>
first himself."</p>

<p>"Well, you hold your tongue," cried Wingate
Morse, tightening his skate-strap; "I wasn't
talking to you."</p>

<p>"Say that again, and I'll pitch into you," declared
the champion with a very red face not
altogether produced by the sharp air.</p>

<p>"Haven't any time," said Wingate, striking
off. "Come on, all you fellow's who are able to
take care of yourselves, and get one good glorious
good-by skate."</p>

<p>All but two, the champion and St. George
went, and their merry shouts came floating
back as the pair left behind took off their
skates, tossed them hurriedly into their waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
bags and set off on a hearty run for the depot.</p>

<p>"I wanted to go awfully," confessed the champion
on the way, "but I'll stick by you, St.
George."</p>

<p>"I'm unpopular," said the Saint, pulling up
into a walk as they came into sight of the depot.
"But I suppose that makes no odds so long as
my mother isn't scared to death when I don't
get home by the right time."</p>

<p>"They're lost, they're lost!" exclaimed the
champion excitedly. "My goodness me! look
at that smoke! She's coming in!"</p>

<p>Sure enough, "She" was. And having no
time to lose other than the moment in which
the champion wildly jumped up and down in a
snow-drift screaming to the fellows, by this time
at the head of the pond, to "Come on&mdash;she's
in!" they soon found themselves in a comfortable
seat, and the train pulling back to town
at a smart rate.</p>

<p>"I lost my head," remarked the champion,
"and that's a fact," as he stumbled along the
aisle; "but then, I guess nobody saw me.
Whew! but won't those chaps catch it, though,
when they do get home."</p>

<p>Just then from the car ahead walked in
Thomas, Mr. Bangs' man. He glanced anxiously
along the car-length, peering right and left.
When his eye fell upon "St. George" and the
champion he brightened up, and hurried as fast
as was possible with his rotundity down to them.</p>

<p>"Where are the rest of the boys?" he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>"Left," said St. George concisely. "Skating
up to the other end of the pond."</p>

<p>It was all told in a second. Thomas said
something which it was well the boys could not
hear in the noise of the bounding train, then
rushed frantically back for the conductor, followed
by St. George and the champion, on the
way repeating&mdash;</p>

<p>"Master Wilfred told me he'd be sure to
catch the train, so I came down the back way,
and jumped on at the last minute. I didn't see
the use of staying another night in that house."</p>

<p>By the time he reached the conductor, realizing
the result of his unfaithfulness to collect all
the boys and bring them safely back to town on
the five o'clock train, the unhappy man was in
such a state that the two boys had to take turns
in explaining to that railroad official what the
matter was.</p>

<p>"Do run the train back," cried St. George
imploringly; "you'll be paid well."</p>

<p>"Are you wild?" cried the conductor sharply.
"This train is bound for town with a lot of
passengers who have something else to do than
to turn back to hunt up foolish boys."</p>

<p>"But they will freeze to death," cried "St.
George" and the champion together. "The
house is shut, and there isn't a neighbor nearer
than two miles." Thomas was too far gone to
do anything but wring his hands and moan helplessly.</p>

<p>"Can't help that," exclaimed the conductor
inexorably, "the world won't lose much. They
should have obeyed orders then." He was
terribly tired and half-frozen himself, and was
getting very nervous at the predicament in
which he saw himself placed. How to help
these people in distress, and yet take care of
his train, was more than he could tell.</p>

<p>"I'll stop at Highslope, though I don't usually
on this night train; as it's the last into town,
we run in pretty fast. There you can get a
wagon or sleigh maybe and drive back ten miles
and pick 'em up. That's the best I can do for
you."</p>

<p>With that he broke away from them and began
to take up the tickets.</p>

<h2>TABLEAUX.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="127" height="135" alt="W" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">"WHAT is going on in the attic?"
asked old Mr. Davidson one
afternoon as he wakened from his
after-dinner nap and heard some unusual
sounds about the old mansion.</div>

<p>"Oh! did the children waken you?
I am sorry," replied old Mrs. Davidson.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon I have slept long enough,"
was the good-natured reply, and you will know
by this that the old gentleman was good-natured,
for it is well understood that to be wakened
from an after-dinner nap is a test.</p>

<p>"I gave the young folks permission to look
over the big chests in the attic," said Mrs.
Davidson. "And I presume they will appear
dressed in some of those old costumes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Davidson was apparently satisfied with
the explanation of the unusual noise, and settled
himself over his newspaper. Presently a young
girl fluttered down the staircase and entered the
room where the elderly couple sat.</p>

<p>"Grandpa," said a fresh young voice, "we
want to come and call upon you."</p>

<p>"Call upon me! Well, what is to hinder?"</p>

<p>"Well, we want to have it a sort of tableau;
we want you and grandma to be the Emperor
of Germany, and cousin John is to be the Crown
Prince, and I am to be 'Vicky,' and we are to
call upon you in state. Lannie is making your
epaulettes. She will come and fix you and
grandma, and tell you where to stand, then when
we get dressed we will enter."</p>

<p>The old people laughed, but grandpa said:</p>

<img src="images/illus64.jpg" width="574" height="452" alt="two men, two women and four children" />
<div class="caption">CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAMME.</div>
</div>

<p>"All right!" and when his wife would have
demurred a little, he said, "We must make
things lively for the young folks or they get
homesick." The programme was carried out.
The satin dress and mantle came out of the old
chest, but those epaulettes and stars and badges!
Let me tell you a secret, they were home-made,
but you would never have guessed it. Cousin
John upon inspecting the work, exclaimed,
"Lannie, you are a genius; how did you know
the way to do it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! there are ways of knowing things,"
returned Lannie, with a good-natured laugh.</p>

<p>After the formalities of the call had been
carried out grandpa said:</p>

<p>"Now, will some one tell us who we are?"</p>

<p>"Not know yourself!" said one, laughing;
"Lannie, tell grandpa who he is."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lannie, who am I, and what have I
done to deserve the honor of this occasion?"</p>

<p>"Why, you are Emperor William the First,
and this is a long time ago when you were
younger and your grandchildren here were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
grown up. And on the whole, I think this is
before the war with France, at which time you
gained great popularity. This is your son, the
Crown Prince of Prussia, and this is his wife,
the daughter of Queen Victoria. And these are
your grandchildren."</p>

<p>"Thank you! I feel better acquainted with
myself."</p>

<p>They all laughed at this and the callers withdrew.
Mr. Davidson settled to his newspaper
again, but presently he looked up to say:</p>

<p>"That was play. But we do belong to a
royal house, eh, mother?" And the wife and
mother smiled; she understood.</p>

<h2>SIR JOHN AND THE EREBUS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THIS is a real Johnny. He was born one
hundred years ago in England. When
a very little fellow he was fond of
the water. He would make little
ships like the one in our picture,
and slip away back of the barn and down
through the bars, which he didn't always
put up in his hurry to the pond among the
trees. Here with his ship he would spend
hours seeing the wind blow it from shore
to shore. When there was no wind to
make it skip over the water, he would puff
sharp blasts from his cheeks against the
sails.</div>

<p>He learned a great deal watching his
ship. And he thought, may be, he would
some day have a big one, be its captain, sail
away off upon the ocean, visit distant lands
and see strange people and strange things.
And he did.</p>

<p>But he was going to school, learning fast
and making many friends by his good conduct.
His father told him one day when
he came from school, right after tea, when
they were sitting about the bright fire, that
he wanted him to learn all he could and make
haste and grow up a good man and be a minister
of Christ.</p>

<p>But though our boy thought it would be a
grand thing to spend his life telling about Jesus
and his love, yet he thought also he could do it
as well in a ship as in a pulpit. And when his
father saw how much he loved the sea, how
much he knew about ships, and how well he
could sail his own little vessel, he consented.
Soon after Johnny was taken on board the ship
<i>Polyphemus</i> as midshipman. He was a sort of
servant, or a <i>cadet</i>, to carry the commands of
the captain. Of course he was very happy.
This was a first step to being captain himself.</p>

<p>But the <i>Polyphemus</i> was a war ship. There
was war at that time and many battles in which
brave men suffered much and died.</p>

<p>He could not escape now if he had wished to.
He did not wish to. One day the <i>Polyphemus</i>
met an enemy's ship and the cannon were soon
sending shot into each other like leaden hail.
Many dropped dead. Johnny did every thing
he was told to, often going right in the midst of
danger. He was brave. Not a shot, however,
hit him. He was in many other dreadful battles
on the sea where the shot were flying all
about him; but he always came off unhurt.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/illus68.jpg" width="305" height="318" alt="boy sailing toy ship" />
<div class="caption">"SIR JOHN AND THE EREBUS."</div>
</div>

<p>Then, being now a man, he was put in command
of a ship. He had sailors and soldiers
under him. He said to one "go here or there,"
and he went; to another, "do this," and he did
it. He was captain over a big ship, and at the
call of his country, away he sailed over the
great ocean to the North to find out what he
could about things in that strange icy land. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
was gone several years, and travelled many thousand
miles. One day as his wife and some
friends stood on the wharf where the ships land
and looked out upon the ocean, they saw a little
thing no bigger than your hand. Then as they
kept looking and wondering what it might be,
it grew larger and larger, and came nearer, and
through their spy glass they saw masts, sails, and
flags flying from the very tops, and then, behold!
they read the name of the ship and they
knew that it was the very ship on which, not
Johnny, nor John, but Sir John&mdash;for that was
his name now&mdash;had sailed more than three
years before.</p>

<p>How the ship soon rode into the harbor and
dropped her strong anchor into the water to
hold her fast, and how the soldiers and sailors
and Sir John came on land, and what he did
and said and what his happy wife, Jane, did, and
how handsome she looked I can't tell you.</p>

<p>But there's another part I will tell you next
time.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE SWEEP.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>SEVERAL years ago, an effort was made to
collect all the chimney-sweepers in the
city of Dublin, for the purpose of education.
Amongst others came a little fellow who was
asked if he knew his letters.</div>

<p>"O yes, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Do you spell?"</p>

<p>"O yes, sir," was again the answer.</p>

<p>"Do you read?"</p>

<p>"O yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And what book did you learn from?" continued
his interrogator.</p>

<p>"O, I never had a book in my life, sir," said
the manly little fellow.</p>

<p>"And who was your schoolmaster?"</p>

<p>"O, I never was at school."</p>

<p>Here was a singular case. A boy could read
and spell without a book or master. But what
was the fact? Why, another little sweep, a little
older than himself, had taught him to read by
showing him the letters over the shop doors
which they passed as they went through the city.
His teacher, then, was another little sweep like
himself, and his book the sign-boards on the
houses. What may not be done by trying?</p>

<h2>A GAME FOR THE EVENING OF WASHINGTON'S
BIRTHDAY.</h2>




<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansies</span>:</div>

<p>I want to propose a new game for to-night.
Let us all see how much good our lessons on
American History, and our knowledge of the life
of George Washington, "first in the hearts of
his countrymen," have done us.</p>

<p>You know that all our studying is for some
good purpose; that it is to enable us to do grand
service for God, and for others. You know
every bit of knowledge upon any good subject
is a powerful weapon to help us in the battle of
life. God gives us our privileges, our schooldays,
our fitting-time. Let us see to it that we
make good use of them all&mdash;<i>every one</i>.</p>

<p>Now then, here is the game. Choose a bright
boy or girl, one who loves history, and who has
been careful to come to the class-room pretty
well prepared the last year. You know who
these nice scholars are. Now send Winthrop or
Lucy as the case may be, out of the room, and
all the rest of you get up as many questions concerning
the early history of our country, before,
during, and just after the War of the Revolution,
being careful to let the interest centre in
George Washington himself, his character, and
services to America.</p>

<p>Now call Winthrop or Lucy in, and launch
the questions, beginning at one end of your
circle of players, and going in turn around the
circuit, each player only asking one question, and
the boy or girl who stands in the centre of the
circle having three moments allowed in which to
answer a question. If there is no clock in the
room some one must give out the time&mdash;father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
or mother, or aunt Susan will doubtless be willing
to do this. If the boy or girl cannot answer
the question, he or she must be fined a forfeit.
Then proceed with the next one in the circle
asking a question&mdash;and so forth.</p>

<p>If it is answered correctly the one who asked
it must go out, and the successful Winthrop or
Lucy can hop into his place.</p>

<p>After this has been played as long as you like,
save the questions (which some one in the room
can write down, with the answers) and let every
girl and boy look over them, and see if they
could be answered better, in fewer words giving
more information, and more correctly. In this
way you will learn to make your knowledge
available, and you will be quite astonished to
find how much you do know about this subject.</p>

<p>Now for the forfeits, for you will probably
have a fine pile to redeem. Let some one be
blindfolded and seated in a chair in the centre
of the room, while another player holds up each
article, and dispensing with the other usual questions,
asks, "What shall the owner do?"</p>

<p>He (or she) shall tell when George Washington's
Birthday was first celebrated.</p>

<p>He (or she) shall tell some little anecdote of
George Washington (not the cherry-tree episode).
And so on, to end with a grand march
two and two, through the parlors and hall, to the
gayest tunes that a deft-fingered performer can
give on the piano.</p>

<p>May you enjoy this "Washington-Birthday-Game"
heartily.</p>

<h2>SOME REMARKABLE WOMEN.</h2>

<h3>J.&mdash;JOAN OF ARC.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-j.jpg" width="70" height="118" alt="J" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">JOAN OF ARC, as we call her in English;
Jeanne D'Arc, as she was called
in her native country; "The Maid of
Orleans," as she is called in history, was
the daughter of a French peasant. In
her childhood and through her girlhood she was
often employed in tending sheep, and so lived
much alone. She grew dreamy and imaginative;
and her young heart was much given to religious
exercises. It is said that she used to spend
hours at her devotions, and when she was thirteen
years old her mind had dwelt so much upon
the superstitious legends of those days that it
was not strange she should in one of those exalted
moods of religious fervor imagine that she
had a vision, and heard voices speaking to her
of the wonderful exploits she was to achieve.
The people among whom she lived were ignorant
and superstitious, and could very easily be
made to believe in anything which had a tinge
of the supernatural. Mythical stories of the
saints, accounts of the doings of fairies and
demons were told around every fireside, and the
children eagerly drank in the strange tales.
What you boys and girls would turn away from
with a decidedly skeptical shrug of your shoulders,
declaring, like a boy I know, "Ghost
stories are no good!" these children of a
dreamy, visionary people drank in as truth, and
very solemn truth too. And so when Joan,
walking in the shadow of the chapel, fancied she
heard a voice and saw a great light, or when
standing at the altar of the Catholic church she
imagined the pictures of the saints coming out
of their frames speaking to her, it is not surprising
that the people of that neighborhood believed
she really saw and heard these things.
And when she imagined that she heard St.
Michael speaking to her and telling her that she
was sent to deliver her country from the English,
some of the people believed it&mdash;but it
appears her father with more practical sense
than the others declared it was only a delusion,
and sought to convince her of the absurdity of
her wild idea. But she could not be persuaded
out of it, and at length when she was twenty
years old the king hearing of her and of what she
considered her mission, sent for her and placed
her at the head of the French army. A number
of curious things are said to have occurred upon
the occasion of her interview with the king.
For one thing she recognized him at once among
his courtiers though she had never seen him before.
Then she told him of a certain sword hidden
in an old chapel which it was necessary to
bring out for her use, though it is said she never
struck a blow; she only led the army, so I suppose
an old rusty sword would do as well as any.</div>

<p>The city of Orleans was besieged by the English.
This city was a stronghold of great importance
to the French, but the starving inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
saw no hope of relief and would very soon
have been forced to surrender. But Joan, the
peasant girl, mounted upon a white horse, and
wearing a suit of glittering armor, rode boldly
forward until they reached the city. The French
soldiers were so inspired by her courage that
they fought their way bravely and the English
on the contrary were frightened. Believing this
young girl to be a witch, they were easily overcome,
though their commander declared that
her pretensions as to having had a revelation
from heaven were all nonsense. But you see the
English soldiers were superstitious as well as the
French. And doubtless it was partly owing to
their fright that the English gave way and
the siege was at an end. Thus having delivered
Orleans, the peasant girl was henceforth
known as "the Maid of Orleans." She
continued to lead the army on to victory, and
finally the coronation of Charles the Seventh,
took place in Rheims. Then Joan felt that her
work was done and asked to be allowed to go
home. But the king would not allow this and
still kept her in the army. But she no longer
heard voices. Her enthusiasm and courage were
gone, and no longer successful, she was at length
taken prisoner, tried and condemned to be burned
as a sorceress. The sentence was carried out, the
king whom she had helped to establish upon his
throne never interfering to save her.</p>

<p>As a visionary enthusiast, we may not hold
up Joan of Arc as a model; but as a noble,
earnest-hearted girl, true to what she believed to
be her heaven-given mission, facing difficulties
and dangers in order to carry out what she
deemed to be the plans of her Lord, we must
admire her and do her honor. At one time she
said, "I would far rather be spinning beside my
poor mother; but I must do this work because
my Lord wills it."</p>

<p>"Joan of Arc was no wilful impostor. She
fully believed that she beheld the faces of departed
saints, and heard the voices of beings
from the unseen world. The result of her wonderful
career was that Charles ultimately won
back to the royal house of Valois the whole kingdom
of France. An imposing mausoleum in
the city of Orleans perpetuates her memory, but
her name stands above mortality, independent of
bronze."</p>

<img src="images/pscorner.jpg" width="378" height="274" alt="The P.S. Corner" />
</div>



<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansies</span>:</div>

<p>How I wish I could coax each one of you to
read this Corner carefully, so you would not
bother your little brains by asking me the same
questions over and over again, which I answer
here! Will you each try it?</p>

<p>To become a member of the P. S. one must
subscribe for <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, at one dollar a year,
send a letter to the editor (Mrs. G. R. Alden,
Chapel street, Walnut Hills, Cincinnati, Ohio)
mentioning some fault or faults which he will
pledge himself to try to overcome; and promising
to try each day to "do some kind act, or
say some kind word which will help somebody,"
always making the Whisper Motto, "For Jesus'
Sake," the strong motive of all words and acts,
not only, but of thoughts as well.</p>

<p>If you would rather not mention the special
fault which you mean to try to conquer, you
have a right to be silent about it; but I can help
you more understandingly if you let me know
your temptations.</p>

<p>All such pledgers will be sent badges, and
their names enrolled on the pledge book. Their
letters will be answered in due time in the magazine;
and the editor will be always glad to hear
from them, and will try to keep her eyes open in
search of that which will help them.</p>

<p>There is also a list of books, games, etc., which
are offered at special prices to the members of
the P. S.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters of subscribers, or even
young friends of theirs who have the reading of
<span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, but are not subscribers, may join
the P. S. by writing to the editor, as described
above, and enclosing ten cents for their badges.
Only enrolled subscribers to the magazine have
badges sent free of charge. Neither can these
members get the P. S. books and games at special
prices. Such privileges are reserved for
those who take the magazine.</p>

<p>An officer's badge is somewhat prettier than
the "private's," and has gold fringe. Any one
who secures five or more subscribers to <span class="smcap">The
Pansy</span>, and pledges from each, is entitled to an
officer's badge.</p>

<p>Officers of a P. S. are expected to call the
members together at stated times, and hold
meetings, for work or reading, or to spend the
time profitably in whatever way they may plan;
always remembering their pledge, and their
Whisper Motto; so, being sure to choose no
occupation that the great Leader under whose
banner they serve might not approve.</p>

<p>Such an organization is expected to have a
secretary whose duty it shall be to report to the
editor of <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, from time to time&mdash;say
every three months, giving a brief account of
their meetings, what they are trying to do, and
how they succeed.</p>

<p>Now will you study this letter with great
care, and see if you fully understand it?</p>

<p>Another thing, will you try to be as patient
as possible about receiving answers to your letters?
Please remember that while you have
but one letter to write, the editor has at least
five thousand to answer! Indeed, I think there
must be more than that number waiting their
turn. I look at the great and ever-increasing
army, and shake my head, and tell them to lie
still and be patient. Then I push into each
<span class="smcap">Pansy</span> as many as I possibly can!</p>

<p>Don't conclude from this that you must not
write any more letters. I don't mean that, at
all. I am only cautioning you to be as patient
as meek little pansies should be, and await your
turn. Meantime, of course, I want to get your
letters; the more the merrier, so that you don't
frown and scold because I do not answer you <i>all</i>
at once.</p>

<p><i>Lucile</i> from Missouri. I do hope, dear little
girlie, that we have rescued those poor fingernails
from any further bad treatment. I made
all haste I could, as soon as I heard of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
needs. It is really wonderful how many naughty
teeth there are in our P. S. biting what they
ought not to touch!</p>

<p><i>Menton</i> from Massachusetts. That is right.
A well "governed" tongue is a most useful
member of society. I know a great many
tongues that were sadly neglected when they
were young, and now are engaged in making all
the people around them uncomfortable. I am
glad yours will never be in that list.</p>

<p><i>Anna</i> from Georgia. Yes, my dear, all members
of the P. S. are subscribers to <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>;
except the little brothers and sisters of subscribers,
who have the use of the magazine in their
homes; those we receive as members, and they
can have badges by sending in their pledges and
ten cents each to pay for the badges. Subscribers
receive the badges free of charge. I
was much pleased with your letter. As a rule,
I know, letters should be written with pen and
ink; but yours was very plain. I hope you are
a faithful scholar in your school.</p>

<p><i>Joanna</i> from Michigan. Thank you for the
card. It was very pretty. I was much interested
in your letter. Yes, I am glad to hear
anything interesting about birds and animals of
every kind. I will copy your letter for the
Pansies to enjoy. It gave me a great deal of
pleasure to notice the resolve you made. If
you keep it, you will have a good and happy life.</p>

<p><i>Anna</i> from Iowa. Here is another Blossom
who "wants her own way." Shall I tell you
how to always have it? Just decide that your
way shall be the one that the Saviour of the
world wants you to have, and then it will be the
right way, and you will always get what you
want. There is a beautiful secret hidden in
that thought; I hope you will hunt for it until
you find it.</p>

<p><i>Anna</i> from Wisconsin. Dear little friend, I
am afraid you expect too much of the P. S., if
you hope that joining it will keep you from
being "selfish" and "spunky." It will help,
but you must do your part, you know. You
would make poor work of mending the hole in
your apron without a needle and thread, but
just imagine what a mess the needle and thread
would make of it without your hands to help!</p>

<p><i>Maud</i> from Pennsylvania. "Dreaming" is
really very pleasant, but you are right, it does
not help work along very well. The best time
to dream is at night when your eyes are tightly
closed. I know a little girl who sat dreaming
she was a fairy, and when she wanted anything
had only to wave her wand and it would come
to her; and she let the water boil from the potatoes,
and they burned to the kettle and were
spoiled; so because of this naughty fairy, the
family had to eat their dinner without potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Auburn</i> from Pennsylvania. My boy, that is
a splendid pledge to take. As I watch the boys
at play, I am constantly wondering what pleasure
they can find in being so "rough" that
lookers-on will be sure to say: "What a disagreeable
boy that is! I should think his
mother would teach him how to behave better
than that." I wonder if the boys know how
constantly mothers are blamed when they do
wrong? I think it would make some boys who
love their mothers more careful. Don't you?</p>

<p><i>Minnie</i> from Minnesota. Were you named
for the State, my dear, or was the State named
for you? What a question! We receive your
name with pleasure. I wish I knew about some
of the "kind acts." Tell us their story.</p>

<p><i>Walter</i> and <i>Laura</i> from New Jersey. We
are very happy to welcome this brother and sister
to our ranks. I wonder if I met you last summer?
I saw a great many boys and girls when
I was at the seaside where you live. Perhaps
you were among them. I remember a sweet-faced
little girl who was trying to speak gentle
words to two older ones who were in ill humor
about something. They called her Laura. Perhaps
it was you, little Blossom. Be sure that
you both shed fragrance about you for Jesus.</p>

<p><i>Fannie</i> from Illinois. Your pledge reminds
me of two boys who were under my window not
long ago. They were very angry; they called
each other hard names, and threw mud at each
other, and at last they took off their little jackets
and began to fight with their strong little
fists. When they were separated, and peace
was declared, it was discovered that they had
been disputing as to whether a small brown bug
which they had found, had four legs or six!
But as the bug had crawled away, I am afraid it
will never be known which was right.</p>

<p><i>Maxwell</i> from Ohio. Yes, indeed, I sent you
a badge, with pleasure. The more boys we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
get to pledge each day to do a "kind act" the
better are we pleased. I believe a boy who
honestly tries to do one good kind act each day,
will grow into the habit of it, so that, some day,
he will do a great many. Don't you think so?</p>

<p><i>Clara</i> from New York. I do not know that
I have ever received a pledge which gave me
more pleasure than yours. To help to lead
others to give themselves to the Lord Jesus, is
the greatest work we can do in this world. God
bless you in your efforts!</p>

<p><i>Cora</i> from New Hampshire. Thank you for
your very high opinion of <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>. I believe
all the Pansies are fond of it. I like to
think of their bright faces when I am writing
anything that I think will please them. I do
everything I can think of, to make it a good and
helpful magazine for them.</p>

<p><i>Stella</i> from Ohio. Oh! not at all too old.
We have many who are older than you. What
an astonishing age your "chicken" reached!
I have never heard of such a thing before. I
should think it would have forgotten how to be
a chicken! Orderly people are very pleasant to
live with. I really do not know much about it
by experience, but I know all about what it is
to travel after a disorderly young person, and put
away hat, and coat, and books, and blocks. I
send my congratulations to your mother.</p>

<p><i>Carrie</i> from Minnesota. Bless her heart!
You certainly do have need of patience. Five
little people to copy all you say and do. If you
chance to slam a door, or bang a book down
hard, or say, "Oh, dear!" in a sharp sort of way,
just as likely as not five doors will slam! and five
"oh dears!" will be singing around the room.
Yet, my Blossom, there is a very sweet side to it;
what a chance you have to help the little lives to
grow up pure, and sweet, and patient. May the
dear Saviour give you a fresh blessing every day!</p>

<p><i>Marion</i> from &mdash;&mdash; You do not give me the
State, so I have to "guess" at it. It always
gives me pleasure to hear of a Missionary Blossom.
I wish you had told us the subject of your
Bible reading. Did you select the verses yourself?
Suppose you send me a copy for the
Pansies? Thank you for the sweet bit of good
news which you gave me at the close of your
letter. Nothing better could have been told.</p>

<p><i>Fred</i> from Massachusetts. Your letter gave
me great joy. When I can write down one of
the P. S. members as a servant of the Lord Jesus,
I always feel so safe and glad. May you be a
brave soldier as long as you live.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie</i> from Nebraska. Welcome. May the
"kind words" you are pledged to speak echo
so far that we shall catch their music and send
them on until they reach around the earth. Nay,
they will reach further than that; every one of
them echoes around God's throne.</p>

<p><i>Agnes</i> from Massachusetts. Do you know I
think it is a very good hint as to a girl's character,
when she says she always likes her teacher?
It is apt to prove that she behaves herself in such
a manner that her teacher can be kind and gentle
to her. Is that it? Remember the "kind
words" you are pledged to speak.</p>

<p><i>Alice</i> from New York. It is a great trial to a
teacher to have whispering girls in her school.
I know how your teacher will rejoice that you
have chosen to break yourself of that habit. I
suspect you will find it hard to do. Don't get
discouraged.</p>

<p><i>Chauncy</i> from Massachusetts. Another boy
with a temper! As soon as I get time, I am
going to count the number of boys in the P. S.
who have already taken that pledge. Then I
shall know the number who are sure to be better
men than they would have been without that
resolve.</p>

<p><i>Mary</i> from Nebraska. I wish you had given
me the name of the fault, my dear Blossom. I
could so much better understand what your
temptations are, and perhaps be able to help you.
Still, you are welcome to all the privileges of the
P. S. Will you let us hear how you succeed?</p>

<p><i>Oscar</i> from Pennsylvania. That is right, my
boy. "By-words," beside being senseless things,
are very apt as you say, to lead one at last into
using profane by-words. I heard an old man
who was trying hard to break himself of that
dreadful habit, say that he began by constantly
using the by-word, "My goodness!" until the
time came when it did not seem to be strong
enough to express his feelings, and he took a
worse form of the same sin.</p>

<p><i>Minnie</i> from Pennsylvania. Another "dreamer."
"I dreamed I was a great merchant," said
a boy to his father, one morning. "Well, you
will never be one," said his father, "for you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
spend your time sitting and dreaming how nice
it would be if you were somebody, instead of setting
to work with a will, and being somebody."</p>

<p>This habit of talking about others is one very
easily formed. If we would always say good
and sweet things of them, I suppose it would do
no harm. Did you ever hear of the dear old
lady who was in the habit of always saying
something good about every one who was mentioned
in her hearing? One day, a daughter
said of her, "I believe mother would find something
good to say about Satan himself, if we
should try it." So they agreed to try the experiment,
and when their mother entered the
room they were talking about how he tempted
people constantly to do wrong. "Yes," said the
dear mother, "I have often thought we might
learn a lesson from his perseverance. He doesn't
waste any time!" As to wearing the badge,
you must be your own judge of when. Some
of the Pansies only wear them at their weekly
meetings; others wear them when they think
there is a reason that they will be specially
tempted to break the pledge. Others wear them
all the time, and when they are soiled, send ten
cents to have them renewed.</p>

<p><i>Mary</i> from Kentucky. How sorry I am for
your disappointment! I do not know how it
happened. We always attend to the badges as
soon as the letters come. But about answers to
letters, sometimes the poor little Blossoms have
to wait until I am afraid they will almost wilt
in their impatience! You see there are so many
thousands of them, that, try as hard as I can, it
is impossible to keep "caught up." We must
each take a pledge of patience, and try to live up
to it.</p>

<p><i>Annie</i> from Massachusetts. That is good
news. It is a great joy to me to hear from
my Pansies that their badges are really helping
them. A great many forget to tell me anything
about it. I hope you will have a very pleasant
visit. When you lie in your hammock under
the trees, looking up into the blue sky, I hope
you will have sweet and helpful thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Nellie</i> from Pennsylvania. My dear, your
pretty things that you make for those who have
none, are to be sent wherever you please.
Some of the Pansies send them to the great
cities, in all of which there are hospitals for the
sick poor children who have no parents to take
care of them. Some select homes in their own
town where they think their gifts would do good,
and send them there. If you have anything to
send, you might select the city nearest you, and
address the package to the matron of the Children's
Hospital, sending a letter of explanation
with it.</p>

<p><i>Julia</i> from Virginia. We are glad that you
find so much pleasure in <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>. Hope
you will succeed with your "club." It is those
who try who are always the successful ones. I
congratulate the "teeth." I know they are
shining over their good fortune at this moment.</p>

<p><i>Ettie</i> from California. You have a "giant"
to fight, it is true; but there is a happy thought&mdash;you
are sure of success if you wear the armor
which the great Captain has provided. Have
you read a careful description of the armor?
And are you clothed in it from head to foot?
We should like to hear something about the
country you live in; the birds, the flowers, the
fruits, anything which interests you.</p>

<p><i>H. A. M. W.</i> from Wisconsin. Dear friend,
what an honor you have bestowed on the P. S.
A "Blossom" which has been cultivated for
threescore years must have a wonderful record
of perfume shed for the glory of the Master! I
regret that your young friends should have had
to wait so long for their badges. There is some
misunderstanding or it would not have occurred.
We try to be very careful, but in a family of
sixty thousand some mistakes will happen.</p>

<p><i>Carroll</i> from Vermont. You have plenty of
company. The people who "start right off" to
do things are few and delightful. They are the
people who will, one of these days, do things
that the world will be proud of. In other words,
in this busy world, one must be "diligent in
business" if he wants to accomplish much. As
to the "hectoring," if you decide to attend
promptly to all your duties, you will find that
you have not so much time for that occupation,
and I shouldn't wonder if it would also lose its
interest to you. Do you know a little couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Satan finds some mischief still<br />
For idle hands to do?<br />
</div>

<p><i>Clara</i> from Michigan. So you don't mean to
tell us what that "worst fault" is? Well, tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
it to Jesus, and ask his hourly help; then you
will overcome it. I hope the badge will remind
you of your Helper.</p>

<h2>WONDER STORIES OF SCIENCE.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>I HOPE that name pleases you, my dear
Pansies, and I wish each one of you had a
copy of the book to which it belongs. Let me
describe the one which now lies on my desk. A
lovely colored binding, I don't know whether
the artists call it "olive" or "old gold" or
"crushed strawberry" or what. It isn't exactly
<i>any</i> color, but reminds me of sunshine and
autumn leaves. There is a medallion in gold on
the upper half, and the monogram of the publishers
on the lower right-hand corner. There
are three hundred and eighty-three pages of good
clear print, and some excellent pictures.</div>

<p>It is a book which retails for one dollar and
fifty cents; and now comes my special bit of
news which ought to rejoice your hearts. Every
subscriber to <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> who is also a member
of the P. S. can secure it for eighty-five
cents, by sending that amount to D. Lothrop
&amp; Co. with their order!</p>

<p>As for the things which it talks about, of
course you know that in so many pages
many interesting topics can be handled; for
instance, "Christmas Cards," and "Newspapers,"
and "Camphor," and "Umbrellas,"
and "Combs," and "Thunderstorms," (!)
and "Brooms," and "Lace," and a dozen
other things. The fact is, if you take one
article, no matter how simple, and seat yourself
in a corner to think about it, you can
get up twenty questions, right away,
which you wish somebody would answer for
you. Well, this book answers those very
questions.</p>

<p>Now I am going to copy for you a bit right
out of the heart of a story in it, which I know
will delight the boys; the name of the story is:</p>




<h3>"TALKING BY SIGNALS."</h3>

<p>When boys live some distance apart, it is
pleasant to be able to communicate with each
other by means of signals. Many and ingenious
have been the methods devised by enthusiastic
boys for this purpose. But it can be brought
much nearer perfection than has yet been done,
by means of a very simple system.</p>

<p>At the age of fourteen, I had an intimate
friend who lived more than a mile away, but
whose home was in plain sight from mine. As we
could not always be together when we wished,
we invented a system of signalling requiring a
number of different colored flags; but we were
not quite satisfied with it, for we could send but
few communications by its use. Then, when we
came to test it, we found the distance was too
great to allow of the different colors being distinguished.
The white one was plainly visible.
It seemed necessary, therefore, that only white
flags should be used. We studied over the problem
long and hard, with the following result.
We each made five flags by tacking a small stick,
eighteen inches long, to both ends of a strip of
white cloth, two feet long, by ten inches wide.
Then we nailed loops of leather to the side of
our fathers' barns, so that, when the sticks were
inserted in them, the flags would be in the following
positions:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/illus85.jpg" width="320" height="252" alt="signal flags" />
</div>

<p>The upper left-hand position was numbered
1, upper right 2, lower right 3, lower left 4,
centre, 5. Notice, there was no difference in the
<i>flags</i>; the <i>positions</i> they occupied, determined
the communication.</p>

<p>Thirty combinations of these positions can be
made.</p>

<p>These combinations were written down, and
opposite each, was written the question or answer
for which it stood. The answers likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
be used most, we placed opposite the shortest
combinations, to save time in signalling. My
old "Code" lies before me, from which I copy
the following examples:</p>

<p>(Then follows a list, and an interesting account
of a flag conversation which you can read for
yourselves when you get the book.)</p>

<p>We usually spent our noon hour conversing
in this manner; and, when it became necessary
for either to leave his station, all the flags, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, were put out, signifying "gone."</p>

<p>One combination, 1, 2, 3, 4, was, by mutual
consent, reserved for a communication of vital
importance, "Come Over!" It was never to be
used except in time of trouble, when the case
would warrant leaving everything to obey the
call. We had little expectation of its ever being
used. It was simply a whim; although, like
many other things, it served a serious purpose
in the end.</p>

<p>Not far from my father's house stood a valuable
timber lot, in which he took an especial
pride. Adjoining this was an old apple orchard,
where the limbs of several trees that had been
cut down, and the prunings of the remainder,
had been heaped together in two large piles to
be burned at a favorable opportunity. One
afternoon, when there was not the slightest
breath of wind, we armed ourselves, father and
I, with green pine boughs and set the brush-heaps
a-fire. We had made the heap in as
moist a spot as possible, that there might be less
danger of the fire spreading through the grass.
While the flame was getting under way, I busied
myself in gathering stray bits of limbs and
twigs&mdash;some of them from the edge of the
woods&mdash;and throwing them on the fire.</p>

<p>"Be careful not to put on any hemlock
branches!" shouted my father from his heap.
"The sparks may snap out into the grass!"</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke, a live coal popped out
with a loud snap, and fell at my feet, and the
little tongues of flame began to spread through
the dead grass. A few blows from my pine
bough had smothered them, when snap, snap,
snap! went three more in different directions.
As I rushed to the nearest, I remembered throwing
on several dead hemlock branches, entirely
forgetting their snapping propensity.</p>

<p>Bestowing a few hasty strokes on the first
spot of spreading flame, I hastened to the next,
and was vigorously beating that, when, glancing
behind me, I saw to my dismay that the first
was blazing again. Ahead of me was another,
rapidly increasing; while the roaring, towering
flame at the heap was sputtering ominously, as
if preparing to send out a shower of sparks.
And, to make matters worse, I felt a puff of
wind on my face. Terror-stricken I shouted:
"Father! The fire is running! Come quick!"</p>

<p>In a moment he was beside me, and for a
short time we fought the flame desperately.</p>

<p>"It'll reach the woods in spite of us!" he
gasped, as we came together after a short struggle.
"There isn't a neighbor within half a mile,
and before you could get help it would be too
late! Besides, one alone couldn't do anything
against it!"</p>

<p>A sudden inspiration seized me. "I'm going
to signal to Harry!" I cried. "If he sees it,
he'll come, and perhaps bring help with him."</p>

<p>"Hurry!" he shouted back, and I started for
the barn. The distance was short. As I reached
it, I glanced over to Harry's. There were some
white spots on his barn. He was signalling, and
of course could see my signal. Excitedly I
placed the flags in 1, 2, 3, 4, and without waiting
for an answer, tore back across the fields to the
fire. It was gaining rapidly. In a large circle,
a dozen rods across, it advanced toward the
buildings on one hand, and swept toward the
woods on the other. We could only hope to
hinder its progress until help should arrive.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes of desperate struggle, and
then, with a ringing cheer, Harry and his father
dashed upon the scene. Their arrival infused
me with new courage; and four pairs of hands
and four willing hearts at length conquered the
flame, two rods from the woods!</p>

<p>My father sank down upon a rock, and as he
wiped the perspiration from his smutty face, he
said:</p>

<p>"There, boys, your signalling has saved the
prettiest timber lot in the town of Hardwick!
I shall not forget it!"</p>

<p>For the way in which the father proved his
gratitude, and what resulted, and a great deal
more which is delightful reading, I must refer
you to the book; for I have already taken too
much space.</p>

<h3>ARTISTIC FAC-SIMILE REPRODUCTIONS OF
ORIGINAL PICTURES.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-d-art.jpg" width="40" height="33" alt="D" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">DESIRING to bring within reach of all homes Pictures of real charm and real art value, we began,
October 1st, the publication of a series of superb fac-simile reproductions of the finest original
pictures belonging to the <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> magazine.</div>

<p>This collection of water colors, oil paintings, and line drawings, gathered during the past ten years,
includes fine examples of eminent American and foreign artists: Walter Shirlaw, Mary Hallock Foote, Wm.
T. Smedley, Howard Pyle, Henry Bacon, Jessie Curtis Shepherd, Harry Fenn, F. S. Church, Chas. S.
Reinhart, Miss L. B. Humphrey, F. Childe Hassam, E. H. Garrett, F. H. Lungren, H. Bolton Jones,
St. John Harper, Miss Kate Greenaway, George Foster Barnes, Hy. Sandham, and others.</p>

<p>And while the skill of foremost engravers has enabled us to give in the magazine many beautiful engravings
from these originals, the mechanical limitations of the graver, and of the steam press, render these "counterfeit
presentments," at their best, but disappointing attempts, to those who have seen the originals with their
greater delicacy and richness and strength. The real touch of the artist's brush, the finer subtler atmosphere,
the full beauty and significance, and the technical excellence, is missing&mdash;and it is these features that are
retained in these fac-similes.</p>

<p>The method of reproduction employed is the new photogravure process of the Lewis Co., which in result
is only equalled by the famous work of Goupil &amp; Cie of Paris. Each impression is on the finest India paper,
imported expressly for this purpose, and backed by the best American plate paper, size 12×15 inches. Only
a limited number of hand proofs will be made. Ordinary black inks are not employed, but special pigments
of various beautiful tones, the tone for each picture being that best suited to emphasize its peculiar sentiment.</p>

<p>These beautiful fac-simile reproductions are equally adapted for portfolios or for framing. They are
issued under the name of</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/wa-artprints-smaller.jpg" width="300" height="37" alt="WIDE AWAKE ART PRINTS" />
</div>

<p>Along with the unfailing and refined pleasure a portfolio of these beautiful pictures will give, attention
is called to their educational value to young art students, and to all young people, as the photogravure process
preserves each artist's peculiar technique, showing how the drawing is really made, something that engraving
largely obliterates.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Wide Awake Art Prints</span> <i>are issued on the first and fifteenth of each month, and are regularly
announced in the magazine.</i></p>


<div class='center'><b>SPECIAL.</b></div>

<p>Keeping in view the interests of our readers, we have decided not to place the Art Prints in the hands of
agents or the general trade. In this way our patrons are saved the retailers' and jobbers' profits, so that
while these beautiful works of art, if placed in the picture stores, would bear a retail price of $3.00 to $10.00,
we are able to furnish them to our readers and patrons at a</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class='gesp'>UNIFORM NET PRICE OF ONLY FIFTY CENTS EACH.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Orders for half-yearly sets of twelve will be received at $5.50 in advance; and for yearly sets of twenty-four
at $10.00 in advance. All pictures are sent in pasteboard rolls, postpaid. Half-yearly and yearly subscribers
will receive each monthly pair in one roll. Portfolios, suitable for holding twenty-four or less, will be
supplied, postpaid, for 75 cts.</p>

<h2>THE PANSY SOCIETY<br />

P. S.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE motto of the Society is "Pansies for Thoughts." What kind of thoughts? Oh, sweet, good, pure, unselfish,
hopeful thoughts, such as Pansies, beautiful Pansies ought to inspire.</div>

<p>Now "who may join?"</p>

<p>Every boy and girl who takes the <span class="smcap">Pansy</span>, and is willing to promise to try to overcome his or her faults, to
encourage every good impulse, to try to conquer some hard lesson at school, to do anything that shows a disposition
to help the cause of right in the world. Any one who will say from the heart: "I promise to try
each day to do some kind act, or to say some kind word that shall help somebody;" honest effort will be accepted
as much as if success were gained.</p>

<p>This promise must be dated, and will be copied into the "P. S." roll-book.</p>

<p>The most important of all to remember is our whisper motto: "I will do it for Jesus' sake."</p>

<div class='center'>
<b>"FOR JESUS' SAKE."</b><br />
</div>

<p>Whatever He will own, the "P. S." will be proud and glad to copy on its roll-book.</p>

<p>Then you must write a letter to Pansy (Mrs. G. R. Alden, Cincinnati, O.), saying that you thus pledge
yourself, and you will become a member of the Pansy Society, and receive a badge.</p>

<p>Now, about the badges.</p>

<p>The officer's is of satin, trimmed with gilt fringe, and has a gilt pin to fasten the badge to the dress or coat.
In the centre is a pansy in colors&mdash;above it the words, <i>Pansy Society</i>, and beneath it, <i>Pansies for Thoughts</i>.</p>

<p>The badge for members will be the same as the officer's, with the exception of having no fringe and a silver
pin.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Pansy</span> will help. As it has always been glad to encourage those who are struggling up toward the
light, so now it reaches forth its helping hand to those little ones who will rally bravely around it, to the work,
of putting down the evil, and the support of all things good and beautiful.</p>

<p>So many of you have little brothers and sisters who want to join the P. S., and who of course do not need
an extra copy of the paper, that we have concluded to receive all such, letting them pay ten cents each for
their badges, if they wish them. Understand! If you are a subscriber to <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, and have a badge, and
have a little sister who would like a badge, write at her dictation a little letter to Pansy, taking the pledge,
telling of some habit which she means to try to break, and enclosing twelve cents in two-cent stamps, ten to
pay for the badge, and two to pay the postage for sending it. Her name will be enrolled as if she were a subscriber.
The same advice applies of course to little brothers. Send your letters to <span class="smcap">Mrs. G. R. Alden</span>,
Chapel Street, Walnut Hills, Cincinnati, O.</p>

<p>It is also asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>What makes an officer of the Pansy Society?</p>

<p>You are to endeavor to organize a club of as many members as you can. Each one forming such a Club or
Society will receive the Officer's badge, and become President of the same. The local Society may contain as
many members as can be secured.</p>

<p>Then, of course, you will plan for your Society; how often it shall be called together, and what your rules
shall be; whether you will sing, or visit, or work, or have a literary society, or read a book. The only thing
you call on the members to positively promise is that each will try to overcome some bad habit, and will take
for the whisper motto the words&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<b>"FOR JESUS' SAKE."</b><br />
</div>

<p>Each member of the "P. S." is invited to write to the editor, Mrs. G. R. Alden (Pansy), Cincinnati, O.,
how far the trial has proved a success, how many temptations have been resisted, how much progress in any
direction has been made, etc., feeling sure of encouragement and loving help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> has extra pages each month under the heading, "The Pansy Corner," in which Pansy holds
monthly talks with her correspondents. There is ample space in the corner devoted to interesting items connected
with the Pansy Society; also letters from its members.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alden would also be pleased to know how the members are getting on&mdash;what they are reading, studying,
talking about, etc., and whether the badges are helping them to keep their pledges.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSEHOLD LIBRARY.</h2>

<p>The Choicest Works of Popular Authors in a cheap and substantial Form.</p>

<p>D. Lothrop &amp; Co. desire to call your attention to their new <b>HOUSEHOLD LIBRARY</b> to be issued monthly at
the low price of <b>fifty cents a volume, $5.00 a year</b>. The works to be issued in this library will be uniformly of
a high standard and may well come under that class of literature styled "home fiction," a literature, that, while free from
the flashy, sensational effect of much of the fiction of to-day, is, nevertheless, brilliant in style, fresh and strong in action,
and of absorbing interest. It is a class that all the young folks, as well as the fathers and mothers and older brothers and
sisters, may read with profit as well as great pleasure.</p>


<p>The first volume in the <b>HOUSEHOLD LIBRARY</b>, was issued Nov. 15th.</p>

<p><b>THE PETTIBONE NAME, by Margaret Sidney</b>, author of <i>The Five Little Peppers</i>, etc.</p>

<p>It is a delightful story of New England life and manners, sparkling in style, bright and effective in incident, and of
intense interest. There has been no recent figure in American fiction more clearly or skilfully drawn than Miss Judith
Pettibone. Most of the characters of the book are such as may be met with in any New England village.</p>


<p>The second volume of the <b>HOUSEHOLD LIBRARY</b> is</p>

<p><b>MY GIRLS. By Lida A. Churchill.</b></p>

<p>A story of four ambitious girls. Their struggles to realize their ambitions and their trials and successes, make a story
of intense interest.</p>


<p>The third volume will be <b>WITHIN THE SHADOW, by Dorothy Holroyd</b>.</p>

<p>"The most successful book of the year." "The plot is ingenious, yet not improbable, the character drawing strong and
vigorous, the story throughout one of brilliancy and power." "The book cannot help making a sensation."&mdash;<i>Boston
Transcript.</i></p>


<div class='center'>
(<i>In Preparation.</i>)<br />
</div>

<p><b>FAR FROM HOME.</b> From the German of Johannes Van Derval. Translated by <b>Kathrine Hamilton</b>.</p>

<p>A fascinating story of life and travel in foreign lands.</p>

<p><b>GRANDMOTHER NORMANDY. By the author of Silent Tom.</b></p>

<p>The story is fascinatingly told. The character of Grandmother Normandy, stern, relentless and unforgiving, almost
to the last, is strongly drawn, and the author has shown much skill in the construction of the story.</p>

<h2>WHAT THE PRESS SAY OF US.</h2>

<p>It would require much more space than we have
at command to quote all the kind and flattering
things the press has said of the publications of D.
Lothrop &amp; Co. And it is matter of just pride to
the publishers to feel that every word of it is deserved.
Below are appended some of these opinions
from standard critical sources:</p>


<blockquote>

<p><b>Five Little Peppers and How They
Grew.</b> (<span class="smcap">Margaret Sidney.</span>) A charming little
story of the home life of a poor but happy family,
whose members, from the mother to the youngest
child, are full of the spirit of helpfulness and of
love for each other.&mdash;<i>New England Farmer.</i></p>

<p>The affection, happiness and goodwill prevailing
among the members of the humble family living
in the "little brown house," as narrated by the
author of this charming volume, cannot but have a
beneficial influence on the disposition of every little
reader.&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Journal.</i></p>

<p><i>Five Little Peppers and How They Grew</i> is a
good title, and no mistake, and Margaret Sidney
has made a thoroughly readable and instructive
story of which it is the name.&mdash;<i>Boston Congregationalist.</i></p>

<p>Of all books for juvenile readers which crowd
the counters of dealers this season, not one possesses
more of these peculiar qualities which go to
make up a perfect story. It ought for the lesson
it teaches, to be in the hands of every boy and girl
in the country. It is finely illustrated and bound
in handsome form, and it will find prominent place
among the higher class of juvenile presentation
books the coming holiday season.&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>A capital story for young readers.&mdash;<i>Eastern
Argus.</i></p>


<p><b>Magna Charta Stories.</b> A real bright and
healthy little volume, showing excellent taste and
judgment on the part of the editor and compiler.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Times.</i></p>

<p>These stories will, we doubt not, be found stimulative
of a love of history, which is the chief design
of the author. It contains a great deal in a
small compass.&mdash;<i>Cincinnati Farmer.</i></p>

<p>The style of each narrative is picturesque and
easy, and all may read these pages with pleasure
and profit.&mdash;<i>Christian Advocate.</i></p>

<p><b>Boy Life in the United States Navy.</b>
This is a right wholesome story of a Maine boy
who enlisted for service on the United States training
ships. The book gives a clear and full account
of the rules, usages, and course of study and discipline
in this department of the naval service. It
depicts in a lively way life on a man-of-war and
contains much information regarding other lands.
Boys are sure to read such a book as this, and to
read this book can have no influence but for good.&mdash;<i>Maine
Sunday-School Reporter.</i></p>

<p>The entire account is a very interesting one, but
we are especially pleased with the information imparted
as to the character of instruction given the
boys entering the United States naval training
service. In this book that is so fully explained
that every reader need have no question to ask in
relation thereto. It tells just how far one can receive
promotion in this line of the service. It is a
very interesting book and one with which boys
will be especially delighted.&mdash;<i>Boston Sports and
Pastimes.</i></p>

<p>Very graphically told, and the boy who reads it
gets a clear and actual idea what a boy must go
through on board a man-of-war before he can
graduate as an "able-bodied seaman." The writer
shows a thorough acquaintance with everything on
board ship, even to the minutest details.&mdash;<i>Cape
Ann Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>Told in a manner to enlist the sympathy and admiration
of all boys, who, however, learn from
the book that the life of a sailor is not all sunshine.&mdash;<i>Brattleboro'
Household.</i></p>


<p><b>How We are Governed.</b> (<span class="smcap">Anna Laurens
Dawes.</span>) Although this book is written in a simple
and explicit manner intended for the comprehension
of young people, many who are not
young would be greatly benefited by studying it.
In short it is a political history, thorough and complete
in its way, and one which should be read by
every voter who is not already acquainted with the
details of government.&mdash;<i>Cleveland Leader.</i></p>

<p>It would be an excellent text-book for our high
schools and academies, as well as a very useful
and attractive addition to the family library. It
will refresh the mind of any reader, however experienced
he may be, and add to the clearness of
his comprehension of the present processes of
government, to read this comprehensive and admirable
treatise.&mdash;<i>Zion's Herald.</i></p>

<p>The specific merits of the book are the clear way
in which the underlying principles upon which our
government is founded are kept in view in explaining
its form and laws, and the simplicity and
familiar phraseology in which this information is
conveyed. Young people&mdash;and old ones, too&mdash;can
learn from Miss Dawes' book what it means to
be an American.&mdash;<i>St. Paul Pioneer and Press.</i></p>

<p>The whole style of the author is simple and helpful,
and the book ought to be welcome everywhere
and preserved for frequent reconsideration. It is
especially commended to young people and such as
have not read the professional writers on the same
subject.&mdash;<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>


<p><b>Wild Flowers and Where They Grow.</b>
(<span class="smcap">Amanda B. Harris.</span>) Just the book that every
young person, or old person, too, for that matter,
who is interested in wild flowers, should have in
hand. It is not a text-book, neither is it an essay
about flowers, but it is a bouquet itself, with bits
of description, and the very information that one
wants. Miss Harris's style is fascinating, and
there is a freshness in this book of the dew and the
wind of springtime.&mdash;<i>Chicago Advance.</i></p>

<p>It is a real pleasure to accompany Miss Harris in
her rambles through fields and woods, where wild
flowers grow, and the pleasure is heightened by
the faithful illustrations contributed by Miss
Humphrey.&mdash;<i>Chicago Journal.</i></p>


<p><b>China.</b> (<span class="smcap">R. H. Douglas.</span>) A good book,
which cannot fail to do much good, as it is eminently
suitable for popular circulation. The work
is particularly well written, amply illustrated, and
remarkably accurate. It ought to dispel forever
the idle illusion that China is a barbarous country.&mdash;<i>Boston
Beacon.</i></p>

<p>Like every book that comes from the press of D.
Lothrop &amp; Co. it is of a high order, paper and
print superior, and a neat as well as useful addition
to the library.&mdash;<i>Elmira</i> (N. Y.) <i>Husbandman.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Alaska.</b> (<span class="smcap">Miss R. Scidmore</span>.) A well written
and exceedingly interesting volume. Miss Scidmore's
descriptions of the various places she
visited and the curious things she saw are vivid
and picturesque, and one can learn more of both
from her pages than from all the official reports
that have been published. It is a book that ought
to have a wide popularity. It is well illustrated
and contains a map reduced from the last general
chart of Alaska published by the Coast Survey.&mdash;<i>Lancaster</i>
(Ohio) <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<p>The author has a bright and pleasant style, and
has the advantage of describing regions which are
little known and ill understood. There are numerous
illustrations.&mdash;<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>A pleasant book, well suited for popular circulation
and a people's library; thoroughly entertaining
as well as instructive.&mdash;<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>


<p><b>Dean Stanley with the Children.</b> The
beautiful book now in hand will make a good
many children and young people familiar with the
name and work of the good Dean of Westminster.&mdash;<i>Chicago
Standard.</i></p>

<p>The sermons here given are full of exquisite
tenderness, and form admirable models for discourses
of like character. Canon Farrar says that
there was not one sermon ever preached by Dean
Stanley which did not contain at least some one
bright, and fresh, and rememberable thing. Mrs.
Humphrey's sketch not only gives us an excellent
idea of the man himself, but also tells us many interesting
things about the great English public
schools.&mdash;<i>Zion's Herald.</i></p>

<p>In this charming book the author makes us feel
the presence of that character so dear to all who
know him&mdash;Arthur Stanley, Dean of Westminster.
Even from his gentle childhood his life
was devoted to Christian truth and Christian
history, and this volume with its information concerning
the illustrious dead, who lies in Westminster,
and its sermons to children is one that every
Christian mother will delight to read with her
boys.&mdash;<i>Springfield</i> (Ill.) <i>Register.</i></p>

<p>An admirable gift book for young people is
Mrs. Humphrey's volume entitled Dean Stanley
with the Children.&mdash;<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>The book has a singularly beautiful moral influence
which commends it to parents.&mdash;<i>Boston
Globe.</i></p>

<p>Every mother will be glad to add this little book
to the children's library, for the record it contains
of the life of a strong and noble character.&mdash;<i>New
Bedford Standard.</i></p>

<p>It is in every sense a timely as well as excellent
contribution to biographical literature.&mdash;<i>Cleveland
Leader.</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Humphrey's book <i>Dean Stanley with the
Children</i>, is a book so winsome that old and young
readers cannot fail to find it fascinating.&mdash;<i>Boston
Traveller.</i></p>


<p><b>The Pettibone Name.</b> (<span class="smcap">Margaret Sidney.</span>)
If the publishers had offered a prize for the brightest,
freshest and most entertaining picture of
home that fiction could give, they could not have
been more successful than in securing <i>The Pettibone
Name</i>, for the story is one that deserves a
wide and enthusiastic popularity.&mdash;<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p>It is always a pleasure to read a well-written
story of every-day life&mdash;one whose characters
appear to be faithful types of humanity. Such is
<i>The Pettibone Name</i>.&mdash;<i>Chicago Times.</i></p>

<p>The story is written with great simplicity, but
with many touches of pathos, and it is not often
that Calvinism is made as touching and attractive
as it is in some of the religious passages.&mdash;<i>Boston
Budget.</i></p>

<p>Unless our judgment be at fault, <i>The Pettibone
Name</i> will create a decided sensation in the world
of fiction. It is so thoroughly free from weak and
sickly sentiment, the characters are so finely and
sharply drawn, and the whole impression so good,
that its success is beyond all question.&mdash;<i>Lutheran
Observer.</i></p>

<p>The story is not only entertaining, but incidents
of New England life and manners are wrought in,
that will give the book more than a transient
interest.&mdash;<i>Advance.</i></p>

<p>"The Pettibone Name," by Margaret Sidney, as
a realistic picture of New England rural society,
has the details of a photograph. Its pages are often
mirth provoking, and yet under them all runs a
current of sober meaning that is impressive. Samantha
Scarritt and Dr. Pilcher are equal to Mrs.
Stowe's best New England delineations; and Bobby
Jane is as thoroughly alive as they. Indeed, the
whole characterization has crispiness and individuality,
and is strong with the flavor of humanity.&mdash;<i>Rural
Home, Rochester, N. Y.</i></p>

<p>"One of the finest pieces of American fiction."</p>

<p>Its two ministers are well drawn. Its village
gossips are "racy of the soil," and in Judith Pettibone,
the Puritan woman with intense family pride
and stern reticence of life, finds a fitting representative.&mdash;<i>Sun.</i></p>


<p><b>How They Went to Europe.</b> (<span class="smcap">Margaret
Sidney.</span>) The story is illustrated and well told,
and is suggestive.&mdash;<i>Herald and Presbyter.</i></p>

<p>This is a charming fresh story of young girl-life,
presented in Margaret Sidney's most attractive
style.&mdash;<i>New Bedford Standard.</i></p>

<p>Margaret Sidney is one of the best and brightest
story writers we have. Her books are just such
as we would place in the hands of every story-loving
boy or girl; pure, bright, fresh and interesting.
<i>How They Went to Europe</i> is no exception
to the standard maintained by her other works.
In it a new and entirely practicable plan for interesting
the young in profitable and stimulating
mental culture is developed. The book is full of
valuable and suggestive ideas, and, withal, is a
very good story.&mdash;<i>Presbyterian.</i></p>

<p>If any author knows how to write for children,
Margaret Sidney does. She can feel and sympathize
with them; all that she writes about is
natural and real, and pervaded by such a spirit as
should eminently recommend it to Christian homes.&mdash;<i>Southern
Sun.</i></p>

<p>This admirable little volume has all the sprightliness
and attractiveness of Mrs. Sidney's other
books, and this is saying a good deal in the way of
praise. Although written primarily for the younger
class of readers, it will have an equal charm for
the older folks.&mdash;<i>Christian Advocate.</i></p>

<p>It is a delightful book, the story is told in a
sprightly way, and is thoroughly wholesome.&mdash;<i>Chicago
Advance.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class='booktitle'>How we are Governed.</div>

<div class='unindent2'>
<b>By Anna Laurens Dawes.</b>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  12mo, $1.50.<br />
</div>

<p>The task undertaken in this work by the accomplished daughter of Senator Dawes, has been to present
an explanation of the constitution and government of the United States, both national, State, and local, in so
simple and clear a way as to offer to the masses everywhere such an opportunity for their study as is not afforded
by the numerous volumes in which such information is chiefly to be sought. She has accomplished
her aim with remarkable success, and her book will have a hearty welcome from the thousands who appreciate
the need of it.</p>


<div class='booktitle'>Lilith: the Legend of the First Woman.</div>

<div class='unindent2'>
<b>By Ada Langworthy Collier.</b>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12mo, $1.00. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <span class="smcap">Gilt edges</span>, $1.25.<br />
</div>


<p>In this book, which is characterized by rare brilliancy of expression, beauty of thought, and tenderness
and pathos in sentiment, and which is withal as intensely interesting as any recent work of prose fiction, the
accomplished author presents a poem based upon the Rabbinic legends that Eve was not Adam's first wife,
but that she had a predecessor in the world's first Eden, who bore the name of "Lilith." The poem, based
upon these legends, cannot fail to establish the writer's reputation as an exceptionally able writer of verse, a
reputation which she has already gained as a writer of prose.</p>


<div class='booktitle'>Boy Life in the United States Navy.</div>

<div class='unindent2'>
<b>By H. H. Clark.</b>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  12mo, <small>ILLUSTRATED</small>, $1.50.<br />
</div>


<p>If there is anything in the way of human attire which more than any other commands the admiration
and stirs the enthusiasm of the average boy of whatever nation, it is the trim uniform and shining buttons
that distinguish the jolly lads of the "Navy." In this graphically written and wonderfully entertaining volume,
boy life in the Navy of the United States is described by a navy officer, in a manner which cannot fail to
satisfy the boys.</p>


<div class='booktitle'>Memorial of Rev. Warren H. Cudworth.</div>

<div class='unindent2'>
<b>By His Sister</b>; <small>WITH PORTRAIT</small>, 380 <small>PAGES</small>, $1.50.<br />
</div>


<p>Simply told and remarkably interesting is this story of the life of one of the most saintly of Christian men.
It will be welcomed and read with satisfaction by all who knew him. Those who never saw him, cannot fail
to be stimulated by its suggestive thought.</p>


<div class='booktitle'>Money in Politics.</div>



<p>This volume presents a complete history of money, or the circulating medium, in the United States, from
the colonial days to the present time. Mr. Edward Atkinson, in his introduction, pronounces it the most valuable
work of the kind yet published.</p>


<div class='booktitle'>Baccalaureate Sermons.</div>

<div class='unindent2'>
<b>By Rev. A. P. Peabody, D. D. LL. D.</b>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  12mo. $1.25.<br />
</div>

<p>These sermons, delivered before the graduating classes of Harvard University, it is safe to say, are not
excelled by any production of their kind. They are not only rarely appropriate, as discourses addressed to
educated young men upon the threshold of active life, but are models of logical thought and graceful rhetoric
worthy the study of all ministers.</p>


<div class='booktitle'>What's Mine's Mine.</div>

<div class='unindent2'>
<b>By George MacDonald</b>, <span class="smcap">author of "Annals of a Quiet Neighborhood," "Donal Grant," etc.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  12mo, <small>CLOTH</small>, $1.50.<br />
</div>

<p>From original MSS. It will be published by D. Lothrop &amp; Co., in advance of the publication in England.</p>


<div class='booktitle'>Boys' Heroes.</div>

<div class='unindent2'>
<b>By Edward Everett Hale.</b>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <span class="smcap">Reading Union Library</span>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16mo, <span class="smcap">Illustrated.</span>    <span class="smcap">Price</span>, $1.00.<br />
</div>

<p>This handsome volume unites the charm of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> with the solid value of an Encyclopædia.
In its twelve chapters, Dr. Hale gives careful and definite account of a dozen famous characters the boys of
all ages have agreed to regard as heroes, but about whom their information is often neither full nor accurate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<div class='booktitle'>Japan and its Leading Men.</div>

<div class='unindent2'>
<b>By Charles Lanman.</b>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <span class="smcap">New Edition, Illustrated.</span>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  12mo, $1.50.<br />
</div>

<p>This volume gives full information of the Empire and also a highly interesting account of the origin of
the American expedition to Japan. One of the most charming sketches of the "Leading Men" is that
of Yoshida Kiyonari, who was for years our minister in Washington, and who with his agreeable wife
entertained with fine hospitality President Grant and his lady while sojourning in Japan. Mr. Lanman
has given in his book information and the result of scholarly research in most graphic language, which will do
much to bring before us the elevated, progressive and gifted Japanese nation. The volume presents to the
student of Japanese political progress, an invaluable work of reference.</p>


<div class='booktitle'>The Children of Westminster Abbey.</div>

<div class='unindent2'>
<b>By Rose G. Kingsley.</b>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Reading Union Library.</span>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  16mo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <span class="smcap">Very fully illustrated from photographs and old prints.</span>    <span class="smcap">price</span>, $1.00.<br />
</div>

<p>What Dean Stanley's famous annals of Westminster Abbey have been to the learned traveller, this volume
by the daughter of Canon Kingsley will prove to the popular tourist and to readers of history at home.
Taking as starting-points the monuments to royal or historic children, the author leads the reader now through
the romantic and stormy paths of secret statecraft, and now among gorgeous pageants of weddings, christenings
and coronations, but always returning into the beautiful silence of the great Abbey itself.</p>


<div class='booktitle'>The Gray Masque and Other Poems.</div>

with some of the choicest bits of poetry contributed to recent periodical literature, such as "Indian Summer,"

public in this unusually attractive volume.</p>

"Some people think 'tis only made<br />
For cleansing goods of heavy grade,<br />
For washing down the walls or stairs,<br />

Or keeping hands and faces free<br />
From chaps and pimples sad to see.<br />
But folks do well to change their mind;<br />
'Tis not to things like these confined,<br />
And not alone the kitchen-maid<br />
And laundress prize its friendly aid;<br />
I find it just the nicest thing<br />
For toilet use and barbering.<br />
The slightest touches will suffice<br />
To make a foamy lather rise,<br />
That holds the beard till smoothly laid,<br />
However dull may be the blade.<br />
